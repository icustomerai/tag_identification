Cruz served as an officer for NCSU Weather and did weekly forecasts for them during his time at NC State.\n\nMost recently, he worked at WBAY-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin. During his time there, he covered plenty of winter weather and severe weather as well. During the winter months, it was brutally cold and snowed, what seemed like every other day. He is definitely experienced in the winter weather department.\n\nCruz's passion for forecasting and his love for weather began at the age of 5. He would watch storms roll in on the horizon with his grandpa and would run outside when it lightened and thundered (instead of staying inside as he should've). He always knew he wanted to study meteorology, but a tornado outbreak in April 2011 that impacted his hometown of Wilson, North Carolina, further solidified his passion for weather. Now he enjoys forecasting severe weather!\n\nCruz is an ambassador for the AMS Latinx Committee and is also a member of both the American Meteorological Society and the National Weather Association.","slug":"","instagram":"wxcruzmedina","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"type":"author","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","custom_gray_displaypriority":"5","last_updated_date":"2023-03-17T13:48:48.798Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wsmv"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-06-26T05:03:12.724Z","description":{"basic":"Strong to severe storms will track through the Mid State tonight.

WCTI 12 in New Bern, North Carolina. There she covered high profile stories such as the deputy involved shooting death of Andrew Brown Jr., marching alongside protesters and CNN crews as they shed light on an ongoing investigation. Sharon has also tracked hurricanes throughout Eastern North Carolina, uncovered mold and poor air quality in schools, covered the 2020 presidential election, and much more.\nBefore moving to New Bern, Sharon spent two months interning as a reporter in West Africa for Joy News in Accra, Ghana. She uncovered poor food quality and shed light on traffic issues that could save lives. Sharon graduated from the University of Miami with a major in Broadcast Journalism and a minor in Sports Administration. During her time at Miami, Sharon worked as a sports and news reporter for UMTV's SportsDesk and NewsVision, two shows on the University's student-run television program. She was also a member of the University of Miami's Women's tennis team, playing singles and doubles. While in college, Sharon interned for the University of Miami's Athletic Broadcast Department, shooting game footage for the ACC Network and ESPN.\nSharon loves trying out new restaurants, cooking, playing tennis, working out, and doing ceramics in her free time. \nWhile Sharon grew up in West Chester, Ohio, she now calls Music City her new home, and she's excited to tell stories of people in the mid-state.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wsmv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-03-17T13:55:25.936Z","twitter":"https://mobile.twitter.com/Sharon_Stories","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/sharondanq","custom_gray_displaypriority":"13"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-06-24T20:35:02.225Z","description":{"basic":"First

He is an Emmy-nominated and multi-award-winning news reporter focused on telling your story and holding the powerful accountable.  \n\nBefore moving to Nashville, Brendan spent three years reporting and anchoring at WSAZ NewsChannel 3 in Charleston, West Virginia. His reporting uncovered cancer-causing chemicals being released into the air at one of the highest rates in the country, constant power outages putting people at risk and misconduct by elected officials. He has interviewed state, national and international leaders to get answers to viewers’ problems.  \n\nWhile attending Syracuse University, Brendan worked at WBNG in Binghamton, New York, as a multimedia journalist.

He specializes in investigations into political corruption, criminal activity and waste of taxpayer money.","longBio":"Jeremy Finley is the chief investigative reporter for WSMV4 Investigates. He specializes in investigations into political corruption, criminal activity and waste of taxpayer money.\n\nJeremy’s investigations have resulted in multiple criminal charges and guilty pleas, TBI and district attorney investigations, new state laws, the resignation of one of the highest paid elected officials in Nashville, a $1 million payout to the victims of a nationwide company scamming the sick and uninsured, and the discovery of missing girls.\n\nThe Nashville Scene wrote that Jeremy is “no stranger to blockbuster expose’s.” He was the first to expose the “unintended acceleration” in Toyota vehicles, which ultimately led to one of the largest recall of automobiles in the nation’s history and Congressional hearings in which his investigations were included.\n\nIt's his investigations into elected officials which prompted the Nashville Post to call him a watchdog for exposing corrupt politicians. After Jeremy exposed an elected official lounging in his bathrobe while claiming to be a meeting, the Nashville Scene called the story, “a devastatingly effective expose ... a piece that has already become part of Nashville's political folklore.”\n\nJeremy’s undercover work has repeatedly exposed thieves and scam artists in action, resulting in guilty pleas. In one notable case, he and a WSMV4 photojournalist found runaway girls hiding in the home of a man accused of squatting in a foreclosed home. The girls were then located by police and the man pleaded guilty to harboring runaways.\n\nJeremy is the two-time recipient of the IRE award, one of the highest honors in investigative journalism. He received the honors from Investigative Reporters and Editors for his stories exposing mistakes made by government agencies during the historic flood that swamped downtown Nashville, and for his contributions to the WSMV4 investigations that exposed the corruption in former Judge Casey Moreland's courts. He’s also been named as a finalist for the IRE award three times, received a national Emmy nomination for investigative reporting, and won a national Headliner award in 2018 for investigative reporting.\n\nHe’s also received twenty Midsouth Emmys, four Edward R. Murrow awards and multiple first place honors from the Associated Press. In 2016, he was named the journalist of the year by the AP, and was named the best large market TV reporter in Tennessee in 2013.\n\nJeremy is reminded daily what’s important in life, thanks to the women who run his life: his wife Rebecca and their two daughters. When they allow him to do so, he’s a voracious reader, repeatedly watches Star Wars, cheers on the St. Louis Cardinals, has an unhealthy obsession with Jeep Wranglers and is a terrible runner.\n\nWhile he’s most proud of his investigations, he admits his favorite assignment was covering the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, for WSMV4 and the other stations owned by the Meredith Corporation.\n\nJeremy is also an internationally published novelist.

just one week before a tornado ripped through Middle Tennessee. Though devastating, the disaster quickly reassured Ryan that he moved to a community of resilient, giving, and passionate people. The unified response showed him why Tennessee prides itself in being the volunteer state.\n\nRyan comes to Nashville from Raleigh, NC where he worked as a multimedia journalist at Spectrum News from October 2016 to February 2020. There he covered multiple hurricanes, fights to keep and remove Confederate monuments, and the NC General Assembly as well as elections.\n\nBefore Raleigh, he was a Video Producer at The Boston Globe and Boston.com in Massachusetts where he’s originally from. Ryan grew up in Wilmington, MA, is a graduate of Wilmington High School, and received a Bachelor’s degree from Suffolk University in Boston where he studied broadcast journalism. He is also an Eagle Scout.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wsmv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-03-17T13:55:01.812Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"10"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-06-23T12:15:22.384Z","description":{"basic":"This

He specializes in investigations into political corruption, criminal activity and waste of taxpayer money.","longBio":"Jeremy Finley is the chief investigative reporter for WSMV4 Investigates. He specializes in investigations into political corruption, criminal activity and waste of taxpayer money.\n\nJeremy’s investigations have resulted in multiple criminal charges and guilty pleas, TBI and district attorney investigations, new state laws, the resignation of one of the highest paid elected officials in Nashville, a $1 million payout to the victims of a nationwide company scamming the sick and uninsured, and the discovery of missing girls.\n\nThe Nashville Scene wrote that Jeremy is “no stranger to blockbuster expose’s.” He was the first to expose the “unintended acceleration” in Toyota vehicles, which ultimately led to one of the largest recall of automobiles in the nation’s history and Congressional hearings in which his investigations were included.\n\nIt's his investigations into elected officials which prompted the Nashville Post to call him a watchdog for exposing corrupt politicians. After Jeremy exposed an elected official lounging in his bathrobe while claiming to be a meeting, the Nashville Scene called the story, “a devastatingly effective expose ... a piece that has already become part of Nashville's political folklore.”\n\nJeremy’s undercover work has repeatedly exposed thieves and scam artists in action, resulting in guilty pleas. In one notable case, he and a WSMV4 photojournalist found runaway girls hiding in the home of a man accused of squatting in a foreclosed home. The girls were then located by police and the man pleaded guilty to harboring runaways.\n\nJeremy is the two-time recipient of the IRE award, one of the highest honors in investigative journalism. He received the honors from Investigative Reporters and Editors for his stories exposing mistakes made by government agencies during the historic flood that swamped downtown Nashville, and for his contributions to the WSMV4 investigations that exposed the corruption in former Judge Casey Moreland's courts. He’s also been named as a finalist for the IRE award three times, received a national Emmy nomination for investigative reporting, and won a national Headliner award in 2018 for investigative reporting.\n\nHe’s also received twenty Midsouth Emmys, four Edward R. Murrow awards and multiple first place honors from the Associated Press. In 2016, he was named the journalist of the year by the AP, and was named the best large market TV reporter in Tennessee in 2013.\n\nJeremy is reminded daily what’s important in life, thanks to the women who run his life: his wife Rebecca and their two daughters. When they allow him to do so, he’s a voracious reader, repeatedly watches Star Wars, cheers on the St. Louis Cardinals, has an unhealthy obsession with Jeep Wranglers and is a terrible runner.\n\nWhile he’s most proud of his investigations, he admits his favorite assignment was covering the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, for WSMV4 and the other stations owned by the Meredith Corporation.\n\nJeremy is also an internationally published novelist. His debut novel, \"The Darkest Time of Night,\" was hailed as one of the best books of the summer by People magazine and the New York Post in 2018. His next book, \"The Dark Above,\" received rave reviews from NPR and the Library Journal. He is busy at work on his third novel.\n\nJeremy is a graduate of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale and has a Master's degree in public affairs reporting from the University of Illinois at Springfield.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wsmv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"investigative","last_updated_date":"2023-03-17T13:50:04.209Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"1"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-06-23T22:13:38.788Z","description":{"basic":"Angie

She was a Multimedia Journalist in Greensboro, North Carolina. In the Triad, she was a nightside reporter who covered various stories ranging from breaking news, government, and even some feature stories. She also covered the tragic UNC Charlotte shooting.\n\nShe started her on-air journey as a Multimedia Journalist in Baton Rouge, LA, where the city was coming together and healing from the \"Baton Rouge 100-year Flood\" that left thousands without homes and devastated parts of South Louisiana.\n\nShe received her Bachelor's of Science degree from the University of West Georgia in Carrollton, GA. There she majored in Mass Communications with a concentration in Broadcast Journalism. Danielle started her career at WSB-TV in her hometown of Atlanta, GA. She was a News Trainee and Assignment Desk Editor, writing for both on-air and web.\n\nShe found her passion for storytelling originally when she became the Editor-in-Chief of her high school newspaper. In college, her passion continued in the form of broadcast television. Danielle uses her medium to both tell the stories of others and to lend a helping hand.\n\nOutside of work, she enjoys shopping, discovering new restaurants, and completing \"DIY\" projects. She's also a member of the National Association of Black Journalists. She's thrilled to undercover stories in the Mid-State.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"type":"author","custom_gray_stationname":"wsmv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"15","last_updated_date":"2023-02-17T02:45:26.723Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-06-23T04:07:05.837Z","description":{"basic":"Police

He is an Emmy-nominated and multi-award-winning news reporter focused on telling your story and holding the powerful accountable.  \n\nBefore moving to Nashville, Brendan spent three years reporting and anchoring at WSAZ NewsChannel 3 in Charleston, West Virginia. His reporting uncovered cancer-causing chemicals being released into the air at one of the highest rates in the country, constant power outages putting people at risk and misconduct by elected officials. He has interviewed state, national and international leaders to get answers to viewers’ problems.  \n\nWhile attending Syracuse University, Brendan worked at WBNG in Binghamton, New York, as a multimedia journalist. He graduated from Syracuse’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications with a degree in Broadcast and Digital Journalism, and was the general manager of CitrusTV, Syracuse University’s student-run television studio.  \n\nBrendan grew up on the Main Line of Philadelphia and is a huge Eagles fan. He got his start in the industry as a production assistant at KYW NewsRadio and CBS Philly after winning the Mark Drucker Award as the most promising young journalist in the Delaware Valley. At KYW, Brendan had the opportunity to assist with coverage of the 2015 World Meeting of Families, 2016 Democratic Convention and more. \n\nOn weekends, you can find Brendan hiking with his golden retriever, Griffin, watching a Formula 1 race and eating lots of ice cream.

He is an Emmy-nominated and multi-award-winning news reporter focused on telling your story and holding the powerful accountable.  \n\nBefore moving to Nashville, Brendan spent three years reporting and anchoring at WSAZ NewsChannel 3 in Charleston, West Virginia. His reporting uncovered cancer-causing chemicals being released into the air at one of the highest rates in the country, constant power outages putting people at risk and misconduct by elected officials. He has interviewed state, national and international leaders to get answers to viewers’ problems.  \n\nWhile attending Syracuse University, Brendan worked at WBNG in Binghamton, New York, as a multimedia journalist. He graduated from Syracuse’s S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications with a degree in Broadcast and Digital Journalism, and was the general manager of CitrusTV, Syracuse University’s student-run television studio.  \n\nBrendan grew up on the Main Line of Philadelphia and is a huge Eagles fan. He got his start in the industry as a production assistant at KYW NewsRadio and CBS Philly after winning the Mark Drucker Award as the most promising young journalist in the Delaware Valley. At KYW, Brendan had the opportunity to assist with coverage of the 2015 World Meeting of Families, 2016 Democratic Convention and more. \n\nOn weekends, you can find Brendan hiking with his golden retriever, Griffin, watching a Formula 1 race and eating lots of ice cream. If you have a story idea, you can email Brendan.Tierney@wsmv.com.

","longBio":"Courtney Allen is a reporter who joined the WSMV 4 team in October 2021. She is originally from Knoxville, TN where her family still lives. She is thrilled to be reporting in her home state. \n\n\n\nBefore WSMV 4, Courtney was a multimedia reporter in Albuquerque, N.M. While Courtney spent most of her time there working from home due to the pandemic, that did not stop her from making a difference in her community. Courtney’s reporting on a local mayor who denied Navajo Nation residents infected with COVID-19 access to a hotel in his town to quarantine grabbed the attention of senators and members of Congress. The state also got involved and ordered the mayor to remove the barricades which allowed the Native Americans living in multigenerational households the opportunity to isolate. Courtney’s reporting also uncovered vaccination disparities for people in certain rural areas which led to the state subsequently launching programs and clinics in those communities. While in New Mexico, Courtney covered a major wildfire for several days. She also reported live during The Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, the most photographed event in the world. \n\nCourtney’s previous stops also include Greenville, N.C. where she covered big stories like Hurricane Florence and the disappearance and death of three-year-old Mariah Woods. Additionally, Courtney reported on the Raleigh teacher rally as more than 50,000 North Carolina educators marched for better pay and more classroom funding. Courtney also did a one-on-one interview with the Attorney General of North Carolina about the backlog of 15,000 untested rape kits in the state. Courtney’s favorite story to date is her special report, ‘The R Word,’ which got her a RTDNAC award for general news reporting in 2018.  \n\nAfter graduating from Louisiana State University, Courtney began her career in Baton Rouge, LA as a breaking news reporter for a local morning show. The show was awarded Best Morning Show by the Louisiana Association of Broadcasters during her time there. \n\nWhile Courtney is from Tennessee, she considers herself new to Nashville.

just one week before a tornado ripped through Middle Tennessee. Though devastating, the disaster quickly reassured Ryan that he moved to a community of resilient, giving, and passionate people. The unified response showed him why Tennessee prides itself in being the volunteer state.\n\nRyan comes to Nashville from Raleigh, NC where he worked as a multimedia journalist at Spectrum News from October 2016 to February 2020. There he covered multiple hurricanes, fights to keep and remove Confederate monuments, and the NC General Assembly as well as elections.\n\nBefore Raleigh, he was a Video Producer at The Boston Globe and Boston.com in Massachusetts where he’s originally from. Ryan grew up in Wilmington, MA, is a graduate of Wilmington High School, and received a Bachelor’s degree from Suffolk University in Boston where he studied broadcast journalism. He is also an Eagle Scout.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wsmv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-03-17T13:55:01.812Z","custom_gray_displaypriority":"10"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-06-23T10:04:45.030Z","description":{"basic":"The
