At Bubba Gump - San Francisco, we charge a surcharge to your total bill to help offset the costs of doing business in San Francisco. The actual percentage of which is disclosed at the particular location. The surcharge is not a gratuity for services provided, nor is it intended to replace or supplement gratuity. The Company uses the amount to offset the higher costs of doing business in San Francisco such as, but not limited to, higher wages, mandatory health insurance costs, higher taxes, and other costs of doing business in the city.
