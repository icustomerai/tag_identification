The far northeastern counties in our portion of Arkansas are under a 3 out of 5 risk for severe weather tonight and into the overnight hours. The main threats across the risk area, including Texarkana in a 2 out of 5 and the Shreveport/Bossier City area under a 1 out of 5, are large hail and damaging wind. The timing of the storms is suspect with model data not agreeing. At this time I am expecting storms to really begin moving into the area between 10 PM and 2 AM.

in broadcast communications. He joined the KSLA First Alert Weather Team in 2022 after a short stint in Peoria, Ill.\n\nAustin was scared of thunderstorms as a kid, but turned that fear into a fascination. After an ice storm greatly impacted his hometown in 2009, it became clear that he wanted to become a meteorologist. \n\nOutside of the studio, Austin enjoys spending time with his partner, Dakota, and their three cats, Stupefy, Poppy, and Soup. He enjoys video games, his favorite of which is the Red Dead Redemption series.

A loving mother to Dominique and wife to George, Angelia and her husband moved to Louisiana from Rogers, Ark. after her husband was offered a position in Bossier. Angelia has only been in town six months, but she’s not new to Louisiana.","longBio":"Angelia Allen joined the KSLA team in March of 2023. A loving mother to Dominique and wife to George, Angelia and her husband moved to Louisiana from Rogers, Ark. after her husband was offered a position in Bossier. Angelia has only been in town six months, but she’s not new to Louisiana.\n\nAngelia was born in West Monroe, where her father currently lives. When her husband was offered the opportunity in Bossier, it was a easy decision. Forever a daddy’s girl, she's excited to be closer to her father. \n\nAngelia has had a very vibrant path in television journalism. She's a Clark Atlanta University graduate from Georgia with a degree in mass communications with a focus in radio TV and film; she has worked in all of these arenas. Her first taste of news was with “CSS Sports In The South\" and “In The House,” a sports show on CNN with Ernie Johnson. During that time, she juggled her passion and fascination for Atlanta’s emerging movie and video scene, landing a director’s assistant job with the Brian Barber and FM Rocks. Angelia has worked with the likes of Whitney Houston to James Brown and countless other actors and entertainers. \n\nIn Los Angeles, working the news angles on investigative projects was a passion, but the bright lights of Louisiana kept calling and news began to take a side seat. Reporting from red carpets and shooting commercials and movies allowed Angelia to experience life on another level. Working behind the scenes in production created an entirely new set of opportunities, skills, and contacts. Moving from a production coordinator to a manager, she was able to also direct on several projects over 14 years and on more than 200 shoots. During that time, she would meet her husband.\n\nAfter leaving Los Angeles (like many do… lol) with years of experience in the heavily competitive entertainment industry, she wanted to focus on social justice. She transitioned from working with major production companies by leveraging her knowledge, expertise, and continued education to make the leap towards the nonprofit sector and politics, with a focus on social justice and DEI initiatives. She teamed up with Mogul Media, a television streaming service that allowed her to quench her thirst for TV, where she was able to produce and develop shows. While getting the word out about elections and building community awareness, she was able to secure interviews with Georgia’s very own Stacey Abrams and Jacari Harris with the George Floyd Foundation. \n\nThis work led her to be a part of “The Conversation Summit,” which travels to major cities, bringing elected officials and community leaders along with the community together to talk about the importance of community involvement, development, and entrepreneurship during a two-day event.\n\nIn her heart, Angelia is an artist when she finds time; she’s painting and working on projects around the house. Her favorite artist is Alma Thomas. She enjoys listening to Thelonius Monk and Alexis Isley.\n\nHer favorite book is anything by Octavia Butler.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"ksla","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"3","last_updated_date":"2023-03-23T15:47:37.601Z","instagram":"angeliaallennews","twitter":"Angelialuvsnews","youtube":"kslachannel12"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-06-26T02:27:49.786Z","description":{"basic":"“...

in broadcast communications. He joined the KSLA First Alert Weather Team in 2022 after a short stint in Peoria, Ill.\n\nAustin was scared of thunderstorms as a kid, but turned that fear into a fascination. After an ice storm greatly impacted his hometown in 2009, it became clear that he wanted to become a meteorologist. \n\nOutside of the studio, Austin enjoys spending time with his partner, Dakota, and their three cats, Stupefy, Poppy, and Soup. He enjoys video games, his favorite of which is the Red Dead Redemption series. He also enjoys listening to his favorite bands, Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco, along with any punk rock he can find.\n\nHelping the community stay safe from anything Mother Nature brings is why Austin does what he

Before joining the KSLA team, Priscilla oversaw two programs for the 2nd Bomb Wing’s Legal Office at Barksdale Air Force Base. Currently, her active-duty husband is stationed at Barksdale. \n\nPriscilla landed her first TV job in Rapid City, S.D., where she was a reporter and anchor at KOTA. She covered local impactful stories, military affairs, treacherous weather conditions, and customized two lifestyle segments.\n\nShe then ventured into a local non-profit organization, where she was exposed to the importance and value of adoption. During her time there, she made sure to keep up with her communication skills. She created local public service announcements, hosted public events to assist in garnering donations, and started contributing reading content for a local parent magazine publication.\n\nShe also spent a few years at the State’s Attorney’s Office working in the juvenile department, assisting the chief deputy attorney in termination of parental rights. She credits her time here as one of the most impactful moments in her careers.   \n\nPriscilla received her bachelor’s degree in broadcast journalism from the University of Central Oklahoma, where her first gig as a student reporter was writing for the school’s newspaper and anchoring their daily newscast. Priscilla is excited to make her way back into the news industry and tell stories that show the beauty of the ArkLaTex communities, to bring awareness to mental health issues, and to showcase the stories that lie within our backyards.\n\nPriscilla wasted no time getting to know her community upon arriving in Louisiana. She's a huge advocate for volunteering and giving back and encourages everyone to do what they can to help make their area a better place to live. Her relationship with Christ keeps her grounded and helps her navigate through life’s valleys and mountains. She's quick to point out that His timing is always spot on, and always has a purpose.\n\nWhen she’s not reporting, you’ll find her elbow deep in dirt, learning new ways to reap a better harvest. Priscilla considers herself a “seasonal developer.” With every growing season, she incorporates a new crop to study and takes pride in cooking with the produce she grows. She's always seeking tips and tricks in navigating different soils and zones, as she aspires to learn more about agricultural.\n\nPriscilla has two children who keep her busy and bring out the best in her. She describes them as being the “light of her life” and is very devoted to empowering their dreams and ambitions. You can also catch her and her family shopping at her local farmer’s markets supporting small business owners and trying to adapt to the humidity!\n\nIf you have any story ideas, she would love to hear from you!\n","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"ksla","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","custom_gray_displaypriority":"3","last_updated_date":"2023-05-08T15:19:48.802Z","author_type":"Staff","instagram":"priscillab_tv","twitter":"PrissB_TV","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089939961901","youtube":"kslachannel12"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-06-23T21:49:07.826Z","description":{"basic":"Non-profit
