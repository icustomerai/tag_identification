								<h1>Contract Sales Success Story</h1>

								<p>Our client, a Fortune 500 medical device manufacturer, needed to downsize 28% of their sales force. They were tasked with continuing to defend their market share with the reduced SG&A budget. This downsizing left them with gaps in certain territories with a need for both sales representation, as well as a clinical presence, to provide support to their customers that would drive product utilization and pull-through.</p>

									<h1>Contract Sales Success Story</h1>	

									<h2>Customer Situation</h2>

									<p>Our client, a Fortune 500 medical device manufacturer, needed to downsize 28% of their sales force. They were tasked with continuing to defend their market share with the reduced SG&A budget. This downsizing left them with gaps in certain territories with a need for both sales representation, as well as a clinical presence, to provide support to their customers that would drive product utilization and pull-through.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Analysis & Recommendation</h2>

									<p>Novasyte consulted with client leadership and examined territory alignment of the restructured sales force. From this analysis, there were certain geographies identified that warranted a sales and/or clinical presence. Novasyte identified the top five territories across the US that lacked the revenue to support a full-line sales representative. Additionally, four other territories needed part-time clinical support.</p>
									
									<p>Novasyte deployed five Sales Consultants in the identified territories working under a full-time model. Four Clinical Consultants were deployed on a flexible basis to support the remaining territo- ries. Our client is responsible for daily activity field task management of the consultants. Novasyte is responsible for scheduling, deployment, human resources, payroll functions, and provides detailed analytics reporting on activity and production.</p>

									<h2>Business Impact</h2>

									<p>
									- 28% reduction in SG&A cost for client<br />
									- 106.1% sales quota attainment by Novasyte Sales Consultant team<br />
									- Client maintained recurring baseline business<br />
									- Client kept competitive threats from gaining market share<br />

									<h1>Contract CNE Teams</h1>

									<p class="summary">A $900 million global leader in the wound care market had the opportunity to compete and win a dual-source contract (valued at $19 million annually) with a large IDN health system. Our customer was in need of a team of Clinical Nurse Educators (CNE) to assist with the end user clinical demands.</p>

									<div class="clear sep"></div>

									<h2>Customer Situation</h2>

									<p>Our client, a $900 million global leader in the wound care market, had the opportunity to compete and win a dual-source contract (valued at $19 million annually) with a large IDN health system. In order to effectively manage the trial, our customer was in need of a team of Clinical Nurse Educators (CNE) to assist with the end user clinical demands. The team would be led by the sales force and interact with both the trial sites, the clinicians utilizing the products and the patients who were being treated. The trial would last over 6 months and would span from Hawaii to Atlanta.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Analysis</h2>

									<p>Before recommending a turnkey solution, Novasyte worked with senior leadership to understand the customers’ (IDN’s) expectations, the geographic regions of interest, the ideal background of candidates and milestones set that would achieve success. This process included interviews with the regional managers involved in the trial, an analysis of the current sales process, mapping the flow of the product from prescription to implementation and a detailed discussion of key lessons learned from previous successes and failures.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Recommendation</h2>

									<p>In order to provide coverage for all locations participating in the trial and to keep the sales force to stay in the field selling, Novasyte recruited a team of six wound care specialists strategically located in “hotbed” areas with a dedicated weekly commitment of 20 hours per CNE. Novasyte utilized its proprietary Virtual Interview Software (VIS) to initially screen all candidates and then shortlisted that group for face-to-face meetings with local managers. Once the Novasyte team of CNEs had been identified, Novasyte implemented its “Boot Camp Training Platform”:<br /><br />
									1) Novasyte Learning Management System (LMS) - eLearning modules provide baseline training on the industry, completion and products<br />
									2) 1 day in-house customer sponsored training event at Novasyte’s Southern California office<br />
									3) 1 week in field training with local rep and Clinical Resource Specialist
									</p>
									<br />
									<p>In addition to the CNE team, Novasyte provided a dedicated Project Manager and Administrator. This team managed all scheduling, weekly contact reports, monthly reviews, back office solutions, payroll, tax filing, expense management and team communication.</p>

									<h2>Business Impact</h2>

									<p>Novasyte’s contract CNE team provided our client with the resources needed to conduct a flawless trial. Because this was a trial and not a conversion, our customer was very cognizant of managing both the customers’ needs and the internal costs. In addition, Novasyte’s program allowed the sales force to stay in the field selling while the trial took place. Our client has been so happy with the results of this particular trial that they have asked Novasyte to propose a national rollout of our Contract CNE Team solution.</p>

									<h1>Just-In-Time CNE Teams</h1>

									<p class="summary">A Fortune 500 leader in the medical device space was dissatisfied with the quality of their current “generalist” clinical staffing firm. Novasyte created a tailor-made solution to assist in all clinical education needs.</p>

									<div class="clear sep"></div>

									<h2>Customer Situation</h2>

									<p>Our client, a $10 billion global leader in the medical device and supply space, had collaborated with a large publicly traded staffing firm to provide all of their staffing needs (forklift operators, accountants, administrators, etc.). In addition to these areas, the staffing organization attempted to provide Clinical Nurse Educators (CNEs) as a resource to assist in the conversion of new products. Our client experienced mixed results in regards to quality of candidates, preparedness and viability as “customer facing” brand representatives. In order to meet the ever-increasing clinical demands of their product portfolio, our client asked Novasyte to analyze the current CNE needs, build a national CNE team, and manage deployment on a conversion-by-conversion basis.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Analysis</h2>

									<p>Novasyte began its initial exploration by interviewing the individual division managers, area managers, and regional managers to understand the clinical needs of each product being implemented. In addition, Novasyte examined the current methods and where they were breaking down. From these discussions, Novasyte focused on developing and deploying a strategic plan that focused on the needs of the product and the geography.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Recommendation</h2>

									<p>With a focus on key geographic hotspots, specialized CNE backgrounds, and concise onboarding, Novasyte recommended a “blended” clinical solution. This “blended” solution consisted of both “Just-in-Time” local CNEs used in conjunction with a “dedicated” team of CNEs who worked a minimum of 20 hours a week. The strategic delivery was inclusive of: <br /><br />
									1) Improve Process Ordering<br />
									2) Improve Candidates Screening (”Brand Representative Model”)<br />
									3) Detailed Onboarding Process<br />
									4) Improve Training Initiatives<br />
									5) Manage Deployment/Scheduling Service
									</p>

									<h2>Business Impact</h2>

									<p>Today, Novasyte provides a transparent CNE team that is designed with both the customer and the sales force in mind. Novasyte has hit key milestones over the 1.5 years we have partnered with this client, including fill ratio, time to fill and “brand representative” identification. With a finely tuned CNE profile, a custom designed Learning Management System (LMS), and a proprietary scheduling tool, Novasyte has provided over 150 hospital conversions, converting over $15 million in new business. In addition to new business converted, Novasyte’s CNE team has defended over $3 million in existing business and provided countless “refresher” courses for end users all while minimizing the FTE cost center.</p>

									<h1>Full Time CNE Teams</h1>

									<p class="summary">A global leader in the ostomy, wound care and incontinence industry partnered with Novasyte to assist in launching a phase II product extension that focused exclusively on the pediatric market.</p>

									<div class="clear sep"></div>

									<h2>Customer Situation</h2>

									<p>Our client, a global leader in the ostomy, wound care and incontinence industry was in the process of launching a phase II product extension that focused exclusively on the pediatric market. Developed in-house and armed with a solid marketing plan, our client was wary of adding FTEs at the CNE level in order to drive adoption. Wanting to give the product launch every chance of success, our client was in need of a “dedicated” clinical solution to assist the sales force (in specific areas) in educating end users during the sales process and post-acquisition on the value of this niche product.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Analysis</h2>

									<p>Novasyte was brought into our client’s pre-launch discussions with an emphasis on understanding the clinical complications and hurdles experienced when converting a new customer. Surveying the regional management team and sales force, Novasyte understood that this particular product required many dedicated hours to assist the end users in full adoption and usage. In addition, it was evident that the CNE team would need to work in lockstep with the sales force in every step of the process (initial introduction, trial, post-trial results delivery and conversion).</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Recommendation</h2>

									<p>Knowing that our customer wanted to launch this product in one particular market (Northeast) and control the launch closely, Novasyte proposed a “Full-Time” CNE solution that would provide all the benefits of an FTE resource without the necessary budget approvals, liabilities, fixed costs, and long-term commitments. Novasyte recruited, screened and deployed one CNE in the Northeast on a six-month Novasyte contract, working directly for our customer. The option of expanding the program nationally based on the success of the product launch has been established as Phase II. <br /><br />
									1) Candidate Recruitment/Identification<br />
									2) Detailed Screening (Virtual Interview Software (VIS))<br />
									3) Employment Verification/Background Check<br />
									4) Weekly Call Reporting/Management<br />
									5) All Necessary Employment Armin. (Insurances/Credentialing/Payroll/Tax Filing/Expense Management)
									</p>

									<h2>Business Impact</h2>

									<p>When the initial product was ready to be piloted, our customer was concerned with adding fixed costs to the launch without truly understanding the market potential. In order to mitigate risk, our client was able to launch their niche product in a pilot market with a “dedicated” CNE resource to support and manage the rollout. Since going live, our CNE has been present on all pre, mid, and post-trial meetings and has participated in driving adoption in the Northeast. Today, our client has leveraged Novasyte across the country to support multiple product launches with a flexible clinical support team that scales up and down as the product is adopted.</p>

									<h1>National Support Team</h1>

									<p class="summary">A Fortune 500 medical device client was presented with an opportunity to garner $35 million in new business due to a competitor in the space withdrawing from the market. Novasyte was the partner of choice to provide over 30,000 hours of education, training and swap out of over 200,000 devices in less than 12 months.</p>

									<div class="clear sep"></div>

									<h2>Customer Situation</h2>

									<p>Our client, a $10 billion global leader in the medical device and supply space, needed a flexible, trusted clinical support partner to assist in a large-scale national conversion. Novasyte worked closely with the senior leadership in all facets of the planning process. In order for this national product swap to seamlessly take place, the customer had to be sure that they would not overburden the existing resources and pull the entire sales force into an “all hands on deck” situation. Knowing that this was going to be one of the many initiatives to accomplish their sales quota for the year, Novasyte was asked to build a national program of over 300 clinical educators to support this pivotal opportunity.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Analysis</h2>

									<p>Novasyte worked closely with the senior leadership to build a national “blueprint” for success. In order to effectively communicate this large-scale initiative, Novasyte attended both the national and regional sales meeting to articulate the controlled process of delivery. Working closely with the regional management team, Novasyte was updated weekly on the status of the pipeline, areas of opportunity, and areas of potential threat.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Recommendation</h2>

									<p>Novasyte began the “national blueprint” by identifying the geographic hotbeds needed for the conversion process to be a success (“must win accounts”). Once these areas were identified, Novasyte’s internal recruitment group began the process of building the team. While the recruitment team operated in the background, Novasyte worked closely with the customer to communicate the process which included several improvements:<br /><br />
									1) Improve Requisition Delivery<br />
									2) Improve Scheduling<br />
									3) Detailed Analytics<br />
									</p>

									<h2>Business Impact</h2>

									<p>Novasyte has successfully built the national support team and is actively deploying against the need. To date, Novasyte has supported over 6,000 hours of service, inclusive of scheduling, deployment, education, swap out and follow-up. Due to Novasyte’s flexible platform, our client has been able to confidently book approximately $14 million in new business to date and is under budget. This has all been accomplished while keeping the sales force in the selling field.</p>

									<h1>Large Scale Product Conversion</h1>

									<p class="summary">A Fortune 500 medical device client was tasked with implementing a 42 hospital IDN system away from a heavily entrenched competitor. The IDN placed significant time constraints around the conversion time and mandated 24/7 support.</p>

									<div class="clear sep"></div>

									<h2>Customer Situation</h2>

									<p>Our client, a Fortune 500 medical device organization was awarded a $7 million new product conversion. The incumbent product had been in the system for over 15 years and had a tremendous amount of legacy support. As a condition of the agreement, our client had to commit to converting all 42 hospitals in less than 60 days. Not wanting to pull the entire sales force into the conversion process for 60 days, Novasyte was chosen to provide a flexible clinical support solution made up of 35 Novasyte consultants that would work in conjunction with the full-time field-based team.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Analysis</h2>

									<p>Novasyte collaborated closely with the senior leadership on understanding the IDN’s expectations, the geographic areas needed to be supported, the timelines for going live in each account, and the schedules necessary to accomplish the allocated budget. Working with a cross functional team on a bi-weekly basis, Novasyte and the client built the plan.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Recommendation</h2>

									<p>The key to executing the plan inside of the 60-day limit was to have multiple conversions take place at the same time. With an orchestrated approach, Novasyte’s team had to work in conjunction with the customer’s sales force to effectively build a proposal for each of the 42 hospitals, articulate and gain acceptance on the plan from the hospital, and then execute against what was agreed upon. All of this was accomplished with multiple facilities coordinated at one time.
									</p>

									<h2>Business Impact</h2>

									<p>Coming in under budget and on time, Novasyte supported our client with a flexible, scalable team of 35 clinical consultants. The IDN considered this particular conversion to be one of the “smoothest” in their history. Partnering with Novasyte allowed the sales force to stay in the field selling while the conversions took place. In addition to increasing sales force selling time, Novasyte was able to decrease the time to revenue recognition and decrease the cost of conversion.</p>

									<h1>National Field Corrective Action</h1>

									<p class="summary">A Fortune 500 medical device manufacturer was in need of a large voluntary field corrective action and needed a way to ensure that the upgrade was done in a timely and efficient manner. Partnering with Novasyte allowed them to upgrade all devices ahead of schedule.</p>

									<div class="clear sep"></div>

									<h2>Customer Situation</h2>

									<p>Our client, a Fortune 500 medical device manufacturer needed additional resources for a large voluntary field corrective action. They were tasked with a necessary software revision of approximately 17,000 ventilators. With a timeline of nine months, our client needed to execute the FCA quickly and efficiently with all their customers across the U.S.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Analysis</h2>

									<p>Novasyte strategized with leadership to determine the key influencing factors of the program, including available resources, timelines, budget, expense management, asset tracking and data management. Novasyte concluded that reaching six to eight units per day would achieve the targeted cost per unit of $150. A budget of $1.5M was established to meet this goal.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Recommendation</h2>

									<p>After calculating the estimated cost and the requirements to complete the upgrade, Novasyte deployed 15 biomedical technicians in multiple hospitals and IDNs across the US. The team were scheduled, deployed and managed by Novasyte throughout the project. Novasyte reported their progress to the client daily on upgrades completed and data entry for the FDA.</p>

									<h2>Business Impact</h2>

									<p>Novasyte was able to successfully build a team that would complete the ventilator upgrade under budget and in seven months versus the original nine-month estimate. With our account management teams, travel program, and logistics management, Novasyte was able to manage client expenses within budgetary limits.</p>

									<h1>Large Scale Hospital IDN System Conversion</h1>

									<p class="summary">A global leader in medical device manufacturing was awarded a large sole source contract with a large scale hospital IDN system. They were in need of a quick and efficient program to convert 571 hospitals and partnered with Novasyte to carry out the full product conversion.</p>

									<div class="clear sep"></div>

									<h2>Customer Situation</h2>

									<p>Our Client, a global leader in medical device manufacturing, was awarded a large sole source contract with a large scale hospital IDN system. The product is a necessity in hospitals with high birth rates and is utilized with every newborn. The conversion needed to take place in 571 hospitals that averaged 300,000 births a year. In order to create a successful conversion, our client was in need of a “Committed” clinical solution.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Analysis</h2>

									<p>Novasyte worked closely with the leadership of the healthcare group and created a budget of $250,000 along with an implementation strategy. The strategy was based on a Tiered approach: Tier 1 represented major hospitals that have more than 1,000 births a year; some of these birth rates reached as high as 25,000 per year. Tier 2 represented hospitals that have 500-1,000 births a year, and Tier 3 and 4 fall below 500 births.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Recommnedation</h2>

									<p>With a high volume of product that needed to be converted and the tier strategy in place, Novasyte recruited, screened, and deployed five field-based educators for Tier 1 and 2 accounts, and utilized one remote-based educator for outbound conversion calls for Tier 3 and 4. We estimated that it would take two days of in-servicing to convert Tier 1 hospitals, one day to convert Tier 2 hospitals, and Tier 3 and 4 would convert via phone support. Along with recruitment and management of the educators, Novasyte also managed scheduling, expenses, and guided the client’s sales force to convert quickly.
									</p>

									<h2>Business Impact</h2>

									<p>With the agreed upon strategy in place, this 571 hospital conversion was completed in just three months. Novasyte was able to come in $25,000 dollars under budget and more importantly, created a strong strategic partnership with our client. From what started as a small product conversion, became a gateway to multiple different programs across multiple business units.</p>

									<div class="clear sep"></div>

									<blockquote>Our team of 6 Consumer Healthcare Sales BDMs, in partnership with Novasyte, converted 164 hospitals during the month of January. That’s 29% of total hospitals, including nearly half of the Tier 1 and 2 (top birth) hospitals!</blockquote>

									<h1>After-Hours Phone Support for New Product Launch</h1>

									<h2>Customer Situation</h2>

									<p>Our Client, a global leader in the medical device industry, targets sleep-disordered breathing, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other chronic diseases. They have been pioneering new and innovative devices and treatments for more than 25 years. This client has recently launched a new ventilator that provides invasive and non-invasive ventilation for patients weighing more than 11 lbs. This new product is primarily utilized in the extended care market. Novasyte has partnered with them to provide additional patient and caregiver support for this product launch.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Analysis & Recommendation</h2>

									<p>As our client commercialized this ventilator, Novasyte identified a gap in their support coverage. They were equipped internally to handle incoming technical and clinical calls during daytime hours with their current staff. However, due to the ventilators’ nature as a life-support device, our client was challenged with having the necessary bandwidth with this same team to cover support calls after-hours and on weekends. Novasyte understands the importance of collecting data around call times, call volume, and most importantly successful outcomes, so a plan was created to support this initiative.</p>

									<p>Novasyte built a team of eight Certified Respiratory Therapists (CRT) that were cross-trained on both the technical and clinical aspects of the ventilator. Novasyte was responsible for all recruitment, deployment, CRM, phone systems, analytics, and expense management. The Novasyte call center VoIP solution delivered reliable mobile, flexible, affordable and cloud-based communications. The CRM solution captured the data from the CRTs around each patient/care-giver interaction.</p>

									<h2>Business Impact</h2>

									<p>Novasyte provided greater bandwidth capability for our client’s internal team for this life-support ventilator. The overall business impact was as follows:</p>
									
									<p>
									> 7,000 hours of annual clinical phone support<br />
									> 60% less time burden on client resources<br />
									> 24/7 clinical hotline provides a value-added selling feature to potential
									customers<br />
									> Additional flexible field resources available

									<h2>Novasyte Analysis & Recommendation</h2>

									<p>Our client’s primary call points for their products are Anesthesiologists. Their standard practice includes a patient discharge satisfaction.

									• Input patient pain and satisfaction scores in a dashboard for client and customer accessibility<br />
									• Benchmark product performance and satisfaction over a twelve month period for our client
									</p>
									
									<p>Novasyte developed the software platform to capture patient case results and an analytics tool. By creating a phone outreach from our full-time clinical team, Novasyte removed the burden of patient follow-up from the physician, while still protecting the physician’s relationship. The data collected from the patient, including pain scores and therapy satisfaction scores, is HIPPA compliant and meets all regulatory standards.

									<h2>Customer Situation</h2>

									<p>Our client, a Fortune 500 medical device manufacturer, needed to downsize 28% of their sales force. They were tasked with continuing to defend their market share with the reduced SG&A budget. This downsizing left them with gaps in certain territories with a need for both sales representation, as well as a clinical presence, to provide support to their customers that would drive product utilization and pull-through.</p>

									<h2>Novasyte Analysis & Recommendation</h2>

									<p>Novasyte consulted with client leadership and examined territory alignment of the restructured sales force. From this analysis, there were certain geographies identified that warranted a sales and/or clinical presence. Novasyte identified the top five territories across the U.S. that lacked the revenue to support a full-line sales representative. Additionally, four other territories needed part-time clinical support.</p>
									
									<p>Novasyte deployed five Sales Consultants in the identified territories working under a full-time model. Four Clinical Consultants were deployed on a flexible basis to support the remaining territories. Our client was responsible for daily activity field task management of the consultants. Novasyte was responsible for scheduling, deployment, human resources, payroll functions, and providing detailed analytics reporting on activity and production.</p>

									<h2>Business Impact</h2>

									<p>
									> 28% reduction in SG&A cost for client
<br />
									> 106.1% sales quota attainment by Novasyte Sales Consultant team
<br />
									> Client maintained recurring baseline business<br />
									> Client kept competitive threats from gaining market share
