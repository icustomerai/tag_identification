Ambrose joined the WDBJ7 weather team in September 2022.","longBio":"Bradford Ambrose joined the WDBJ7 weather team in September 2022.\n\nHe started his career in February 2018 at WDBJ7’s sister station, WALB News10, in Albany, Georgia. While there, Bradford covered several tropical systems, including the destructive, Category Five Hurricane Michael. He was also on-air for countless severe weather events, including numerous tornadoes.\n\nIn July 2020, Bradford moved to the coast and joined the Fox affiliate in Savannah, Georgia. Two weeks into his new job, he covered Hurricane Isaias. The system came close to the area, passing about 65 miles off the coast. In April 2022, Bradford was on the air for more than two hours as an EF-4 tornado ripped through a community about 30 minutes west of Savannah. It was one of the strongest tornadoes to hit the U.S. that year.\n\nBradford was born and raised down the road in Richmond, Virginia. He studied at Virginia Commonwealth University and Mississippi State.\nWhen he isn’t working, Bradford loves to spend time with his family and friends. He’s thrilled to be back in the Commonwealth and covering the weather in southwest Virginia.\n\nBe sure to say hi if you see him around town. He loves meeting viewers and interacting with them on social media.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"wdbj","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"weather","last_updated_date":"2022-09-18T17:39:36.459Z"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-06-25T21:58:28.555Z","description":{"basic":"The

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east. During the trip came this opportunity, and here he is!\n\nPat is a huge fan of the Bee Gees, Michael Keaton, the LA Dodgers and the color purple.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2021-11-19T17:27:28.600Z","location":"Roanoke

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east.

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east. During the trip came this opportunity, and here he is!\n\nPat is a huge fan of the Bee Gees, Michael Keaton, the LA Dodgers and the color purple.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2021-11-19T17:27:28.600Z","location":"Roanoke

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east. During the trip came this opportunity, and here he is!\n\nPat is a huge fan of the Bee Gees, Michael Keaton, the LA Dodgers and the color purple.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2021-11-19T17:27:28.600Z","location":"Roanoke

including ACC football and basketball. He also covered the Virginia men’s basketball team’s run to the national championship in 2019, including the Final Four in Minneapolis.\n\nPrior to covering sports, Anthony worked out of WDBJ7’s New River Valley bureau, covering news in the NRV starting in May 2018.\n\nAnthony previously worked at KOMU-TV in Columbia, Missouri, where he was part of the sports and news team, covering University of Missouri athletics and local high school sports. Anthony graduated from the University of Missouri School of Journalism with a bachelor’s degree in broadcast sports journalism in 2018. He also earned a bachelor’s degree in statistics while studying at Missouri.\n\nWhile there, he served as the sports director of his campus TV station, MUTV, where he hosted a sports game show, Triple Play, and covered athletics, as well as the campus protests of 2015. His work has been featured in national outlets, such as Reuters. He is excited to carry on the proud Mizzou journalism tradition at Your Hometown Station!\n\nBefore attending college, Anthony grew up in the village of Massapequa Park on Long Island, New York. He is an avid fan of New York sports, especially the Yankees, Giants, Rangers and Knicks. In his spare time, you will often find him watching a game (and likely tweeting about it, @ARomanoWDBJ). He also enjoys playing golf, traveling and exploring his new home in Southwest Virginia!\n\nA resident of Roanoke, Anthony is excited to tell the stories of the athletes of Southwest

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east. During the trip came this opportunity, and here he is!\n\nPat is a huge fan of the Bee Gees, Michael Keaton, the LA Dodgers and the color purple.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2021-11-19T17:27:28.600Z","location":"Roanoke VA","custom_gray_stationname":"wdbj","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-06-25T16:31:34.328Z","description":{"basic":"CONGRATULATIONS!

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east. During the trip came this opportunity, and here he is!\n\nPat is a huge fan of the Bee Gees, Michael Keaton, the LA Dodgers and the color purple.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2021-11-19T17:27:28.600Z","location":"Roanoke

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east. During the trip came this opportunity, and here he is!\n\nPat is a huge fan of the Bee Gees, Michael Keaton, the LA Dodgers and the color purple.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2021-11-19T17:27:28.600Z","location":"Roanoke

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east. During the trip came this opportunity, and here he is!\n\nPat is a huge fan of the Bee Gees, Michael Keaton, the LA Dodgers and the color purple.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2021-11-19T17:27:28.600Z","location":"Roanoke VA","custom_gray_stationname":"wdbj","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-06-25T01:02:48.180Z","description":{"basic":"Ramel L.

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east. During the trip came this opportunity, and here he is!\n\nPat is a huge fan of the Bee Gees, Michael Keaton, the LA Dodgers and the color purple.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2021-11-19T17:27:28.600Z","location":"Roanoke

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there. An honor was when he was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters' Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, his wife retired, their kids being grown, and they decided to try another part of the country, so they sold the house, packed everything into PODS and headed east. During the trip came this opportunity, and here he is!\n\nPat is a huge fan of the Bee Gees, Michael Keaton, the LA Dodgers and the color purple.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2021-11-19T17:27:28.600Z","location":"Roanoke

He moved from music radio to news/talk as a news anchor and then talk show host. \n\n2006 is when he became a writer and producer of a new Reno 10pm CW newscast, and when that ended in 2008, he moved to the ABC affiliate as a producer. That led to stints as assignment manager and digital content manager over the course of his 11 years there.
