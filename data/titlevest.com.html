                            the number and frequency of visitors to each web page, the length of their stays and like
                            information, as well as the anonymous information automatically sent to us by your web
                            browser, such as browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and
                            subsequent to visiting this Website, and IP addresses. We also may determine what technology
                            is available through your browser in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a
                            web page.</p>
                        <p>IP Addresses: An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you are on the
                            Internet. When visitors request pages from this Website, our servers log the visitor's IP
                            address. We may collect IP addresses for a variety of internal purposes, such as system
                            administration and to audit the number of visits to different pages on this Website.</p>
                        <p>Cookies: A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about
                            the user. We may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as tracking usage patterns on
                            the Website or matching the most relevant Web content to your particular needs. We will not
                            use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent by us to
                            you in a cookie. You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in
                            the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of
                            this Website will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. You should consult with your
                            browser's provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies.</p>
                        <p>Web Beacons: While you are on the Website, or while you are otherwise viewing our content,
                            you may encounter Web beacons, which may come from Titlevest or from third parties, such as
                            content providers. A Web beacon, which is sometimes also called a "Web bug" or "clear gif,"
                            is a small graphic image in a Web page, a Web-based document or an e-mail message, which
                            generally allows the party that set the Web beacon to monitor certain information about the
                            viewer of the Web page, Web-based document or e-mail message, and it may allow access to
                            certain cookies. Web beacons are usually invisible to the user, because they are small. In
                            general, however, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page, including an
                            advertisement, can act as a Web beacon. Web beacons typically collect the URL of the page
                            the Web beacon comes from, the type of browser requesting the Web beacon, the IP address of
                            the computer that the Web beacon is sent to and the time the Web beacon was viewed. Web
                            beacons can also be linked to personally identifiable information. We may aggregate
                            information we collect through Web beacons. Titlevest does not have control over Web beacons
                            used by third parties and does not have access to whatever information they may collect.</p>
                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold  py-3">How Do We Use and Disclose the Information We Collect</h5>
                        <p>We use the personally identifiable information you provide to ascertain whether you are an
                            appropriate user of this Website, to contact you regarding goods and services, and for other
                            purposes disclosed at the time of collection.</p>
                        <p>We may share non-identifying aggregate information with third parties. However, we will not
                            share your personally identifiable information with outside parties unless you specifically
                            agree to a governing set of rules that allow such disclosure or otherwise give us permission
                            to do so.</p>
                        <p>We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Our
                            employees, agents and contractors who have access to personally identifiable information are
                            required to protect the information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
                        </p>
                        <p>We may provide access to your personally identifiable information when legally required to do
                            so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against
                            misuse or unauthorized use of the Website, to limit our legal liability and protect our
                            rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors of this Website or the
                            public. In those instances, the information is provided only for that purpose.</p>
                        <p>In the event Titlevest goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired
                            by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in
                            most instances, be part of the assets transferred.</p>
                        <p>We will not share your personally identifiable information in ways unrelated to those
                            described above without providing you with an opportunity to opt out of such use or
                            otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.</p>
                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold  py-3">How To Access or Correct Information or Modify Your Choices
                        </h5>
                        <p>In certain instances you may visit the registration area of this Website where you will have
                            the opportunity to access certain of your personally identifiable information, to correct
                            errors in such information, and to update your preferences regarding what information you
                            may receive from us. It may take us up to five (5) business days to process your changes,
                            but we will do so as quickly as we can. You should be aware, however, that it is not always
                            possible to completely remove or modify information in our databases.</p>
                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold  py-3">Third Party Content</h5>
                        <p>When you are on the Website, certain content may be created or hosted by a third party. Such
                            third parties may drop cookies and/or use Web beacons, which may be used to identify some of
                            your preferences or to recognize you if you have previously been to their Website or
                            otherwise had contact with them. We do not control the use of such technology by third
                            parties, the information they collect, or how they use such information. Such third parties'
                            use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, which may differ from this one. We
                            do not disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties serving content on
                            this Website in connection with the serving of such content. Such third parties do not have
                            access to our cookies.</p>
                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold  py-3">Data Security</h5>
                        <p>We take physical, electronic and managerial steps to maintain the security and accuracy of
                            personally identifiable information we collect, including limiting the number of people who
                            have physical access to our database servers, as well as electronic security systems and
                            password protections that guard against unauthorized access. However, we make no
                            representation, warranty or guarantee that such information will remain secure and accurate
                            at all times. In addition, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be
                            completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information
                            you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
