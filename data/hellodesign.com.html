Like the starlight taking years to hit our eyes, we can't always pinpoint the exact correlation between events of the past and who we are today. We are moments that add up, collected and built upon like a scrapbook. Not just life's big occasions, but the everyday ones too—a lazy day reading, a camping trip, a bike ride in the rain, the sound of the trees outside our childhood windows. It's these fleeting moments in time that shape who we are and how people perceive us. \"How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives,\" wrote Annie Dillard, which rings true.",{"type":25,"content":12220},[12221],{"text":12222,"type":29},"At Instrument, when we talk about branding, we think about experience in a similar way.

Because of this multitude of touchpoints, it's no longer just about showing up once a year with a lofty statement or a million-dollar tv spot; it's about all the little moments that add up. It's about connecting the dots between brand, marketing, and product and having each of those experiences ladder up to the company's core. When a brand consistently demonstrates its reason for existing it will naturally build trust through positive experiences. Over time, many good experiences lead to a deeper connection, while a handful of bad ones inevitably end in apathy.",{"type":25,"content":12232},[12233],{"text":12234,"type":29},"Of course, that's easier said than done. There is such a cacophony of information out in the world that to cut through it all and be heard, or seen, a level of consistency and repeat excellence is needed. Brands need systems and platforms that increase their efficiency, and remove variability. But these systems should go beyond codifying a brand into rigorous style guides. Brands don’t just live inside pitch decks and brand books. They live out there in the real world, in people's minds and hearts. Or at least on their periphery. Many brands make the mistake of defaulting to consistency above all else. But inevitably, this leads to sameness and complacency. In order to reach people and stay relevant, brands need to be fluid. The goal is to provide tools that empower internal teams to engage with customers in new creative ways that express that brand’s unique personality—all while staying grounded in their values.",{"type":25,"content":12236},[12237],{"text":12238,"type":29},"Brands succeed when they show customers that their purpose is more than a marketing initiative—prioritizing real action over hollow virtue signaling.

four years ago, Instrument created a function in our Operations Team known as Human Development. You may have heard about it. For some of our current employees, this article, and this concept of bringing your whole self to work, is what sparked their desire to work here. While the concept of Human Development mostly feels very obvious and necessary—it actually isn’t always the normal approach of companies. Truly leading with care, ensuring balance, setting expectations, exceeding expectations and providing equitable support—in order to enable our employees to constantly be evolving—is the foundation of Human Development, and the reason I show up every day.

It has also become impossible to separate our whole selves from our work selves. We are literally working in the middle of our personal lives: we hear dogs barking, we see kids running around, we are hearing of illness around us and all of my co-workers now know that we turn our books around on our bookshelves (yes—because it’s more neutral, yes—it isn’t easy to loan books when they are backwards). Because of this, and when we move into the next stages of this pandemic, we need to keep making equitable decisions and operating with inclusivity at all times—because our whole selves are inevitably showing up, and I need everyone to be okay with that.

I was caught up in the preparation of ensuring our employees had what they needed to work remotely: the technology, the access to internet, the ergonomic set-ups to take care of their bodies, the support, the sense of community, the care. And then I realized, this is what equity looks like in the time of a crisis. Preparing policies and communications that provide support, before anyone has to ask for it. Acknowledging that we understand everyone’s situation is different, before anyone has to say it. Committing to providing different options, or levels of support, depending on each individual’s specific needs, with the flexibility that each of our situations require. Creating open dialogue and vulnerability—from the top down. And making safe spaces for communication so that when we all inevitably move through different stages of this challenging time, we at Instrument have already promised—and shown—our utmost love, care and support.
