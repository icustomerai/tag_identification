Over 130 nuclear units worldwide rely on Holtec\u0026rsquo;s technology for dry spent nuclear fuel storage and transportation; 70 of these units are located in the U.S. Highlights of Holtec\u0026rsquo;s core business focus also include the safe and efficient decommissioning of shuttered nuclear plants; the current fleet includes Indian Point, Pilgrim and Oyster Creek.\u0026nbsp; Holtec\u0026rsquo;s decommissioning model includes the assumption of the entire plant including the spent nuclear fuel. HI-STORE, the world\u0026rsquo;s first below-ground Consolidated Interim Storage Facility for spent nuclear fuel, is currently undergoing licensing for deployment in New Mexico. Holtec\u0026rsquo;s SMR-160, a 160-Megawatt small modular reactor, will provide safe, secure, dependable, affordable and carbon-free power even in the world\u0026rsquo;s most arid regions. As a major supplier of special-purpose pressure vessels and critical-service heat exchange equipment, Holtec provides air-cooled condensers, steam generators, feedwater heaters, and water-cooled condensers. As a fully integrated supplier, Holtec possesses in-house capabilities to design, engineer, analyze, license, fabricate and construct these technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMedia Contact:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMedia Contact:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cem\u003eTim Kovach\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cem\u003eMarketing Communications Manager\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cem\u003eMitsubishi Electric Power Products, Inc.

Both companies will research methods for scaling up the application of clean-air insulation technology to higher voltages. They\u0026rsquo;ll start with a 245-kV dead-tank circuit breaker that will speed up the availability of climate-neutral high-voltage switching solutions for customers around the globe.

Even with a very low number of leakages, the impact on global warming is significant. In light of the drive toward global decarbonization, the demand for alternatives is growing as operators seek future-proof technologies that significantly reduce the carbon footprint of their systems. At the same time, regulations to reduce or prohibit the use of fluorinated gases in the electrical industry are being reviewed and implemented in various parts of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSiemens Energy and Mitsubishi Electric are pioneers in the development of high-voltage switching solutions. Both companies have been working on the development of SF6-free gas-insulated switching solutions that replace the greenhouse gas with clean air, a pure mixture of nitrogen and oxygen, in order to contribute to global carbon-neutrality goals. To date, clean-air insulation is the only alternative to greenhouse gases and therefore poses zero health and safety risks. In conjunction with vacuum interrupters, a higher performance for switching applications is ensured, even compared with all known SF6 circuit breakers.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eSiemens Energy\u0026rsquo;s Blue Portfolio offers future-proof and environmentally friendly solutions for high-voltage power transmission. It comprises F-gas-free gas-insulated switchgear, circuit breakers, and instrument transformers. The combination of vacuum-switching technology and clean-air insulation enables a significant reduction of emissions, while the lifetime of the products can also be increased. While circuit breakers that use clean-air and vacuum-switching technology have been available for at least 15 years for voltage levels up to\u003cbr /\u003e72.5 kV, the outstanding technical performance and low lifecycle costs also make it a perfect choice for other substation products, including gas-insulated switchgear up to 145 kV, with absolutely zero CO2 equivalent emissions over the lifetime of the equipment. Siemens Energy\u0026rsquo;s\u0026nbsp; Blue products lie outside the scope of any conceivable F-gas regulation.\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eMitsubishi Electric provides a variety of high- and medium-voltage products to ensure the safe and reliable operation of modern power networks.

First, HVDC transmission allows for elimination of towers and aerial cables by using underground and submarine transmission. As power generation becomes more distant from the power consumer, this is essential to all power utilities. Placing towers and aerial transmission has become almost impossible in populated areas. In areas where aerial facilities exist, is the ability to construct a DC plant on existing AC tower paths, replacing AC lines.

First, HVDC transmission allows for elimination of towers and aerial cables by using underground and submarine transmission. As power generation becomes more distant from the power consumer, this is essential to all power utilities. Placing towers and aerial transmission has become almost impossible in populated areas. In areas where aerial facilities exist, is the ability to construct a DC plant on existing AC tower paths, replacing AC lines.
