                        <p><em>Due to the constantly-evolving nature of COVID-19, PETRONAS Canada has to adapt our approach to safe operations. To that end, we commit to making the best choice based on current data at any given time, which may result in changes. We appreciate your ongoing support in helping to maintain the health and safety of all workers and we will keep you updated as we continue to evaluate our position. Changes will be communicated via additional messaging and bulletins.</em></p>

                        <p>Asymptomatic testing will no longer be required for staff, vendors, or visitors at PETRONAS Canada worksites. However, symptomatic testing will still remain in place to access our worksites. All PETRONAS Canada staff, vendors, and visitors (Calgary and Fort St. John) are required to continue daily health checks to ensure compliance with COVID-19 screening requirements and confirm they are fit to access a PETRONAS Canada worksite.</p>

                        <p>PETRONAS Canada remains committed to ensuring safety at our worksites and will continue to monitor the situation and adjust our approach, as necessary.</p>

  <p> We still require any individuals who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 to notify a supervisor (staff and vendors), get tested and refrain from accessing our worksites in the meantime. PETRONAS Canada will provide Rapid Antigen Detection Tests (RADTs) upon request to staff and vendors who need them. RADTs can be requested by calling our <b>COVID-19 hotline at 250-467-2387</b>.</p>

  <p>Individuals with symptoms who receive a positive COVID-19 result are required to call our <b>COVD-19 hotline</b> and refrain from accessing PETRONAS Canada worksites for five days and until you no longer have a fever, and your symptoms improve (regardless of vaccination status).</p>

  <p>Individuals with symptoms who receive a negative COVID-19 result will follow similar protocols. If you receive a negative COVID-19 result, notify your supervisor and refrain from accessing PETRONAS Canada worksites until you no longer have a fever, and your symptoms improve.</p>

  <p>We appreciate your ongoing support in helping to maintain the health and safety of our workforce and we will keep you updated as we continue to evaluate our position.</p>

Starting in April, 2022, PETRONAS Canada will begin welcoming our staff back to our offices using a phased approach.

                                <h4>Mental Health</h4>
                                <p>As we head into 2022, the world continues to face uncertainties associated with COVID-19. These challenging times can take a toll on our physical and mental health and well-being, and, in turn, impact how we show up to work every day. PETRONAS Canada continues to encourage all members of our workforce to look out for one another, maintain a work-life balance, and access the variety of well-being resources and supports available through the company, including our well-being hub and the Employee Family Assistance Program.</p>
                                <h4>Physical Health</h4>
                                <p>Effective February 1, 2022, PETRONAS Canada, with the support of our Board of Directors and the Leadership Team, will be implementing a COVID-19 Vaccination Mandate Standard which will apply to anyone accessing a PETRONAS Canada worksite (including our offices, camps and field sites). Contractors and vendors can view the more detailed bulletin <a href="/files/pdf/Vaccine-Mandate-Standard-Guideline-for-Contractors-December-13-2021.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
                                <p>Despite the rapid testing protocols we have in place, we continue to have a number of confirmed positive cases amongst our workforce, particularly in the field – that puts our people, the communities where we operate, and the company at risk as well as adding strain to already stretched public healthcare systems.</p>
                                <p>Based on the scientific information from the various levels of public health authorities in Canada and from around the world, being fully vaccinated is the most effective way to reduce severe outcomes due to COVID-19 and help mitigate the associated pressure on healthcare systems.</p>
                                <p>In addition to mandatory vaccination of all staff, the following site controls will still be in place:</p>

                                <ul>

                                        <p>At PETRONAS Canada, we want our employees to be as physically, mentally and emotionally healthy as possible. As our workforce continues to face isolation to help protect physical health, it is important that we monitor our mental health and the mental health of those around us. Stress can manifest in different ways for different people: feeling distracted, forgetting common tasks or even trouble sleeping, could be early indicators of mental health struggles. </p>
                                        <p><strong>STEPS WE ARE TAKING</strong></p>
                                        <p>Since March 2020, we have encouraged our employees and contractors to work remotely, wherever possible, while continuing to maintain our operations. As the COVID situation evolves, so does our approach to office access in Calgary and Fort St. John. Our offices will not re-open on wide-scale until it is safe to do so.</p>

                        <p>Effective August 2, 2022, asymptomatic testing will no longer be required for staff, vendors or visitors at PETRONAS Canada worksites. However, symptomatic testing will still remain in place to access our worksites. All PETRONAS Canada staff, vendors and visitors (Calgary and Fort St. John) are required to continue daily health checks to ensure compliance with COVID-19 screening requirements and confirm they are fit to access a PETRONAS Canada worksite. </p>
                        <p>PETRONAS Canada has determined that asymptomatic testing no longer provides the protection it once did - new data indicates that the virus is not often spread by asymptomatic individuals. PETRONAS Canada remains committed to ensuring safety at our worksites, and will continue to monitor the situation and adjust our approach as necessary.</p>

                        <p>We still require any individuals who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 to notify a supervisor (staff and vendors), get tested and refrain from accessing our worksites in the meantime. PETRONAS Canada will provide Rapid Antigen Detection Tests (RADTs) upon request to staff and vendors who need them. RADTs can be requested by calling our COVID-19 hotline at 250-794-5673.</p>

                        <p>Individuals with symptoms who receive a positive COVID-19 result are required to refrain from accessing PETRONAS Canada worksites for five days and until you no longer have a fever and your symptoms improve. If you are not fully vaccinated and receive a positive COVID-19 result, you are required to refrain from accessing PETRONAS Canada worksites for 10 days and until you no longer have a fever and your symptoms improve. </p>

                        <p>Individuals with symptoms who receive a negative COVID-19 result will follow similar protocols. If you receive a negative COVID-19 result, notify your supervisor and refrain from accessing PETRONAS Canada worksites until you no longer have a fever and your symptoms improve. </p>

                        <p>In the last few months, the COVID-19 landscape across the country has changed. General guidance from health authorities has changed and most restrictions have been lifted. In light of those changes, the COVID-19 Vaccination Mandate Standard that took effect on February 1, 2022 for PETRONAS Canada staff, contractors, vendors and visitors to access our worksites (including our field operations and offices in Fort St. John and Calgary) has been lifted as of June 20, 2022. As such, <strong>proof of vaccination demonstrating fully vaccinated status is no longer required to access our sites.</strong></p>
                        <p>To access PETRONAS Canada worksites <strong>the following measures remain active:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A negative Rapid Antigen Detection Test (RADT) is required on the first day of an individual's shift/rotation to access our worksites and offices.</li>
                                <li>Daily health checks to ensure you are compliant with COVID-19 screening requirements and fit to access a PECL worksite. If you have symptoms or are ill, isolate and immediately report this (even if minor) to your supervisor, who will then notify a PETRONAS Canada representative on your behalf to initiate case management. Do this daily health check in your camp room or at home before you report to our worksites.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>Through consultation with medical professionals and after a complete risk assessment, the decision was made to lift the Vaccination Mandate Standard in Alberta and B.C. PETRONAS Canada will continue to monitor and communicate changes to our measures and protocols as needed.</p>

                                <p>PETRONAS Canada has phased out some COVID-19 protocols that no longer provide the value they once did. Our risk-based plan to remove restrictions is possible because of our highly-vaccinated workforce and the current COVID-19 situation in Alberta and B.C. Effective March 1, 2022, PETRONAS Canada changed some of our COVID-19 protocols. In an effort to help vendors understand what is required to access PETRONAS Canada’s worksites, please note the following.</p>
                                <p><strong>Requirements to access a PETRONAS Canada worksite:</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Currently there are no changes to PETRONAS Canada’s Mandatory Vaccination Standard that was implemented on February 1, 2022.</strong></li>
                                    <li>All workers, visitors and vendors physically accessing a Company Worksite must be fully vaccinated as defined by health Canada.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Proof of vaccination is required</strong> (worksite medics or in the absence of a medic a PETRONAS Canada representations will review/scan vendor’s vaccine card - QR code).
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>In the Calgary office this will be done in room 1672. For the Fort St. John office: vendors may be asked for proof of vaccination by PETRONAS representatives, so it is important that they have that proof with them.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Day 1 negative Rapid Antigen Detection Testing (RADT).</strong> This is required on the first day of your shift at worksites or in office.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Daily health check.</strong> This is your daily self-assessment to ensure you are compliant with COVID-19 screening requirements and fit to attend a PECL worksite. If you have symptoms or are ill, isolate and immediately report this (even if minor) to your supervisor. Do this daily health check in your camp room or at home before you report to work.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>No longer required:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Masking</strong> – Upon completing a risk assessment on our masking requirements we have determined that the risk of being unmasked is low for the majority of our vaccinated workforce. As a result, we changed our mandatory indoor masking protocol across all our PETRONAS Canada worksites including: our private camps, offices and field facilities.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>If you are staying in an open camp, these can be considered public indoor spaces and thus subject to the province of B.C.’s current mask mandate.</li>
                                            <li>If an open camp has a mandatory mask mandate - this is applicable to all guests including PETRONAS workers.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>TempSafe (temperature checks).</strong></li>
                                    <li><strong>Health Screening Questionnaires and Compliance Letters.</strong> As indicated above, the daily health check/daily self-assessment has replaced these administrative controls.</li>
                                </ul>
                                </p>
                                <p>Our decision to adjust these protocols is based on risk analyses that considers our broad workforce. That said, not everyone’s comfort level and individual health-risk profile is the same, so it’s important you make decisions that are right for you. If you have health factors which may put you at risk of more serious symptoms, are more comfortable continuing to wear a mask, or doing more frequent rapid antigen detection tests, PETRONAS Canada will support you.</p>
                                <p>Our Pandemic Response and Crisis Management Teams will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and evaluate the remaining protocols we have in place. What will not change is our commitment to doing what we can to keep our workplaces as safe as possible based on the information available to us.</p>

                                <p>Beginning on February 1, 2022, all PETRONAS Canada staff, contractors, vendors and visitors to our worksites (including our field operations and offices in Fort St. John and Calgary) will be required to produce a government-issued QR code to prove vaccination status. Verified exemptions will be considered for medical and religious reasons. Negative antigen tests will no longer be accepted in lieu of proof of vaccination.</p>
                                <p>Currently we are following guidance from the Government of Canada for acceptable vaccines.

                                <p><strong>Protecting Our Communities, Families, Workforce and Operations</strong></p>
                                <p><em>At PETRONAS Canada we demonstrate our commitment to the communities where we operate through meaningful and concrete action. The steps we have already taken to adapt to the changing COVID situation, were taken to protect and mitigate risks to healthcare systems in Alberta and in particular northeast B.C. While these measures help to address the current situation, we will continue to monitor COVID and make further changes as required.</em></p>
                                <p>The situation in Alberta and British Columbia continues to evolve with government guidance adapting to COVID-19, helping to stop the spread. Cases continue to rise at our worksites and many of our PETRONAS Canada teams are working around the clock to help protect our workforce, friends and families, our communities and our operations.</p>
                                <p>While the rise in COVID-19 cases remains a concern, it has led to collaborative discussions and approaches around preventative health and safety measures. In addition to addressing the health risks at PETRONAS Canada’s worksites, we must remain vigilant to protect healthcare systems in Alberta and British Columbia so people who need medical assistance can access it when they need it most.</p>
                                <p>On September 15 the Government of Alberta declared a State of Public Health Emergency and implemented new public health restrictions in response to rising COVID-19 cases and the associated strain on the healthcare system.</p>
                                <p>In addition, the Chief Medical Officer of <a href="https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/covid-19-information#testing-and-results#trusted-info#northern-health" target="_blank">Northern Health</a> in B.C. has informed us of their duty to protect the health and wellness of residents and visitors within Northern B.C. Without a clear understanding of the actual and ongoing vaccination rates of workforce populations, they are unable to accurately estimate the risk to public health and apply appropriate mitigations.</p>
                                <p>As such, and in addition to the protocols announced previously around mandatory masking in our offices, camps and worksites, in both Calgary and British Columbia, <strong>PETRONAS Canada has rolled out the following additional requirements for all of our workforce, including contractors, effective September 27.</strong></p>
                                <p><strong>For our workforce in the field and in the office:</strong></p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>A completed PETRONAS clearance letter must be presented upon arrival to the worksite. This clearance letter confirms that the worker has passed their Health Screening Questionnaire and identifies whether the worker needs to complete rapid antigen testing to access the worksite.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Where individuals are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19, rapid antigen testing (negative result) is required prior to accessing a PETRONAS worksite and at regular intervals during the work shift to be completed at a location provided by PETRONAS.</li>
                                            <li>Workers participating in the rapid antigen testing program must coordinate pre site-access tests.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Subsequent rapid antigen testing completed during the work shift will be done twice per week, every four days by the site Medic.</li>
                                    <li>Providers that do not meet the requirements of a clearance letter or rapid antigen testing protocol will not be permitted on PETRONAS’ worksites.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>PETRONAS Canada expects that all workers reporting to a PETRONAS Canada worksite are diligently confirming their health and access eligibility. Falsifying worker vaccination status or COVID-19 testing information will result in disciplinary action which may include, but not be limited to, termination for cause/default.</p>

                    </a>
                    <div class="expand-content clearfix">

                        <p><em>Going the extra mile for causes that matter to them is something employees have been doing for years.</em></p>

                        <p>People in and around Fort St. John (FSJ) heard four of our employees on the radio earlier this month and it wasn’t for the launch of their debut single. These employees stepped up with their voices to encourage others in the community to donate to the FSJ Hospital Foundation’s annual “Have a Heart” Radiothon.</p>

                        <p>Organizers of the foundation’s 19th radiothon campaign had set a goal of raising $35,000 to fund the purchase of obstetric probes that will be use with the portable ultrasound machine in the birthing centre.</p>

                        <p>PETRONAS Canada, previously Progress Energy, has been a supporter of the FSJ Hospital Foundation for as long as we’ve been operating in the area. Since 2012, the company has donated more than $140,000 to the foundation helping ensure resources are available to purchase medical, diagnostic and surgical equipment for patients who rely on the hospital for care and treatment. </p>

                        <blockquote>“This year, instead of simply writing a cheque, we thought we could encourage others to join us in supporting such a vital organization,” says Shannon Young, Director, External Affairs. “Four of our employees recorded brief messages that played several times on the local radio station leading up to the radiothon, explaining that PETRONAS Canada would match the first $10,000 raised.”</blockquote>

                        <p>Between the amount raised by callers during the radiothon on June 17 and PETRONAS Canada’s match, the FSJ Hospital Foundation raised $46,000.</p>

                        <p>The FSJ Hospital Foundation is just one of the many charitable groups that PETRONAS Canada supports in the areas where we live and work. Employees are ardent supporters of charities and non-profits too. In fact, in addition to choosing to support charities through donations of time and money, every employee can request PETRONAS donate $250 to a charity that is important to them.</p>

                    </a>
                    <div class="expand-content clearfix">

                        <p>I'm growing weary of reading headlines, where we learn of more heartbreaking acts of hatred, racism, and tragedy. I’m thinking about all our colleagues, and everyone around the world, who are part of the Islamic faith. The news out of London, Ontario is appalling and has left me exasperated. To target someone – and in this case a whole family – based on their religion is beyond comprehension. Despite what many want to believe, racism in Canada is still prevalent. </p>

                        <p>On behalf of the PETRONAS Canada Leadership Team, I want to reinforce that discrimination, racism and hate have no place in Canada. Last week I shared internally a message about the Kamloops Residential school tragedy. I wrote about the ccollective responsibility we have to access learning opportunities, to have challenging conversations with our friends and families, and to press forward in ensuring moments like this are not lost to time. The same holds true after this latest tragedy.</p>

                        <p>Last year I <a href="https://bcbc.com/media/statement-b-c-business-and-community-leaders-take-a-stand-against-racism-we-say-no-to-hate-it-must-stop-now">signed a statement</a> issued by the Business Council of British Columbia that denounced the rise in racist attacks in B.C. during the pandemic. I recently saw a stat that indicated that more than half of Asian Canadians have experienced discrimination in the past year. The problem is not going away. We can – and must – do better individually and as a nation.</p>

                        <p>In my role as CEO I’ve had the opportunity to build relationships Muslim colleagues in Malaysia, here in Canada and around the world. Part of that includes learning about their culture, religion and belief systems. At the top of my learnings is that the Islamic faith is peaceful, compassionate and spiritual.</p>

                        <p>As we continue to face unprecedented challenges in Canada and around the world, I encourage people to find appropriate resources, like the ones below, to assist with struggles and understanding.</p>

                        <p class="large">As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, charitable organizations have been deeply impacted. </p>
                        <p>This year, given the immediate, rising community needs, we donated $50,000, each, to the United Way of Northern BC and to the United Way of Calgary and Area to support their COVID-19 relief and response activities. </p>
                        <p>To support critical, life-saving work, we donated $20,000 to the Fort St. John Hospital Foundation and also provided the funds needed to professionally outfit nurses with personal protective equipment, such as masks and face shields, through Brogan Safety Supply, a local company.</p>
                        <p>In addition to medical concerns, many in the community are finding it difficult to put food on the table. As a result, we looked for ways to enable communities to focus on staying home and staying healthy. To the Calgary Food Bank, we provided $10,000 for items they feel are most needed. To the Silver Willows Court seniors’ residence in Hudson Hope, we provided funds to build a planter where residents can get outdoors and grow vegetables. To Abbeyfield seniors’ residence in Fort St. John we provided funds to buy meat from a local butcher. To Fort St. John’s Better at Home program, we covered the cost of 400 hot meals for seniors prepared by a local catering company. </p>
                        <p>As the COVID-19 situation evolves, we will continue to work with our community partners – which includes consulting with the First Nations communities closest to our operations – to identify what meaningful support they may need to lessen the negative effects of this pandemic.</p>

                    <div class="expand-content clearfix">

                        <p>With the British Columbia hydro power grid more than 100 kilometres from where we explore for and produce natural gas, generating the electricity we need, day and night, at our well pads across northeastern B.C. and minimizing emissions can be a challenge.</p>
                        <p>We’re always exploring ways to adapt our existing practices to lessen our impact on air, land, water and wildlife. Over the past decade, we’ve made substantial strides to reduce the carbon footprint at our well pads – the most significant of which has been integrating the use of solar panels to offset some of our power needs. </p>
                        <p>While we’ve had great success harnessing energy from the sun, we haven’t been able to generate enough electricity from solar panels alone to run all of our equipment at isolated and remote locations. For these sites, the best option to drive pneumatic instruments and pumps was to use natural gas we produce on-site. </p>
                        <p>Although pressurized natural gas has enabled safe and reliable operation of pneumatic devices at remote well sites for decades, the natural gas used by the pneumatic system is primarily methane and is vented to the atmosphere. Pneumatic venting is responsible for almost 50 percent of our methane emissions and seven percent of our overall greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint (on a CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent basis). </p>
                        <p>In our quest to achieve meaningful reductions in GHG emissions we accelerated the development of technology that eliminates pneumatic venting. Our engineering team worked closely with a Canadian technology company to install and test a 20-kilowatt power generation and air compression system at remote well sites. </p>
                        <p>The system is beneficial in two ways: first, it prioritizes solar power over natural gas generators to compress instrument air (in place of methane) to drive pneumatic devices; and second, when there are periods of insufficient solar energy, our natural gas generator takes over to ensure an uninterrupted power for the entire well site. Now, emissions only occur for short durations during the winter when the generator needs to supplement the power at site.</p>
                        <p>With testing complete, we are incorporating this new power system into all of our new well pad designs. By doing so, we expect to prevent approximately 1,600 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e per pad per year, which represents 99 percent of all GHG emissions from our traditional well pad, from entering the atmosphere – that’s roughly equal to the emissions produced by 350 gasoline-powered cars. </p>
                        <p>This new system allows us to tackle our largest methane emissions source and achieve meaningful GHG emission reductions. Over the next few years, we will investigate opportunities to retrofit existing well pads with this new power system as a way to further reduce our GHG footprint. </p>
                        <p>We believe that we can accelerate finding solutions to the environmental challenges we face as an industry when we commit to working together, which is why we are sharing learnings like this with other producers in forums such as the <a href="http://www.ngif.ca/" target="_blank">Natural Gas Innovation Fund</a>.</p>

                        <p class="large">Operating a natural gas processing plant requires a considerable amount of power – much more power than we’ve been able to harness from the sun using solar panels or fuel cell technology. </p>
                        <p>As part of our commitment to responsible development, the bright minds of our scientific and mechanical staff designed a solution that not only meets the power needs of our phased growth in the Town Area, but also uses technology that reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from our typical plant design. </p>
                        <p>An easy solution would have been to connect to the British Columbia power grid since the vast majority of the province’s power is created using hydroelectric generation but, given that it’s more than 100 kilometres away from our operations, that’s not possible at this time. The option that made the most sense economically and helps us achieve the lowest carbon footprint, was to build a co-generation plant, on site. </p>
                        <p>A co-generation power plant produces electricity using natural gas turbines, while simultaneously capturing and repurposing the waste heat from the turbine’s exhaust. The exhaust heat recovery modules redirect the residual heat to the heating needs of the facility without the need to install additional natural gas-fired boiler equipment. The net effect is that we burn less natural gas then we typically would to create the same amount of energy.</p>
                        <p>We anticipate this new design, with a total of three turbines, will generate between 33 and 38 megawatts when it’s fully operational (enough power for 3,800 homes) and represents an emissions reduction of approximately 30 percent over our typical plant design. </p>

                        <p class="large">Extreme cold, heavy rainfall and heavy equipment take a real toll on the vast network of roads that lead to our facilities in northeast British Columbia. Keeping these unpaved roads free of axel-breaking potholes and snow is a year-round activity. </p>

                        <p>As part of an ongoing effort to support local First Nation businesses, PETRONAS has signed road maintenance agreements with two First Nation businesses, with the second one happening in late 2019 with Tall Ten Resources Ltd. By providing road maintenance work guarantees, these companies are able to borrow the capital needed to buy a grader. </p>
                        <p>The idea for this kind of agreement came from our Road Maintenance team. It creates steady, year-round work that’s critical to the safety of our operators, who travel thousands of kilometres across our operations each year. Another advantage, is that this network of roads is divided into areas that create natural boundaries, which means we can more easily have multiple companies doing our road maintenance work. </p>

                    Thank you for your interest in becoming a supplier or contractor (vendor)
                    of goods and/or services for PETRONAS Canada. At the core of our vendor
                    engagement strategy is an assessment of how a new vendor will:

                        Share our commitment to safe operations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Deliver cost-effective and innovative solutions with excellent service.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide the greatest degree of economic benefit and employment as
                        possible to those within the communities where we operate, which is
                        factored into vendor selection and competitive tender evaluation
                        criteria.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Provide economic and employment opportunities to the local area
                                First Nations within whose traditional territories we operate.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Engage with locally owned and operated businesses that employ local
                                area residents.
                            </li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    As such, we encourage new vendors to not only provide details about their
                    product or service offering, but also illustrate how the new vendor will
                    advance our objectives including how local economic benefit and employment
                    will be measured over time.
                </p>
