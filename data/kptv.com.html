Meteorologist Mark Nelsen can be found forecasting weather in most of our evening newscasts. That could be 4 p.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m., 8 p.m., 9 p.m., 10 p.m., or the 11 p.m. shows. Or sometimes ALL of them.\n\nMark is a Pacific Northwest “local.\" He’s spent all of his adult life and almost all of his childhood within a 2 hour drive of Portland.\n\nBORN: Hood River, OR\n\nSCHOOL YEARS: Mt. Angel, OR and Chehalis, WA\n\nCOLLEGE: University of Washington. B.S. Atmospheric Science\n\nMark is proud to be a “weather geek” and we all know what that means! He was one of those kids that turned in late homework because he spent too much time staring out the window.\n\nHe tried for several TV jobs straight out of college in the early 1990s but they all told him he “looked like a teenager.\" Instead Mark took a short stint at a small local company forecasting wind in the Columbia River Gorge. Once he looked like an adult... at 24, Mark was hired by KOIN-TV then moved to FOX 12 in 2000. That’s 28 years on Portland TV!\n\nYou might be surprised to find out Mark is a “country person,\" living only a few brief years in cities. He lives with his wife and two kids near Corbett on farm/forest land. They have quite a few chickens, ducks, and two cats. Mark loves to grow things too. A dozen apple, pear and peach trees are surrounded by berries and a summer garden each year.\n\nOne quirk? Mark gets annoyed when you spell his name NelsOn instead of NelsEn. It’s an E not an O!\n\nYou can find more from Mark on his very popular FOX 12 Weather

She had worked at KPTV for several years beginning in the late 90’s before taking some time away to raise her two kids.  Now they are (mostly) grown up and she is excited to be back!  \n\nAnna is originally from Hawaii, but started her career at KNDO-TV in Yakima, Washington.  After anchoring for a couple of years at KFSM-TV in Fort Smith, Arkansas she moved to Oregon to join the team at KPTV.  Later, she anchored and reported for KOIN-TV.\n\nShe loves to travel but spends most of her time these days right here at home, watching her son and daughter play sports.  She is thrilled to once again be using her talents as a journalist to serve the people who live in Oregon and Southwest Washington, a community which has been home for decades now.  \n\nAnna would

During her two years there, she also reported on the fun parts of Louisiana too! Whether it was Mardi Gras or crawfish season, there was no shortage of good food and king cake.\n \nDrew is originally from Southern California. After high school, she went to Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communications in Phoenix (Go Devils!!!) where she was a reporter for the school's daily broadcast on Arizona PBS.\n \nWhen she's not working, she likes to cozy up with her cats Ira and Pod to watch the newest show on Netflix. Since moving to Oregon mid-pandemic, she hasn't gotten to try all the best food spots in town yet. So, if you have any movie or takeout recommendations - she's all ears!

Lindblom was thrilled to join the FOX 12 team in August 2022.  \nAlthough Jeffrey spent his childhood near Chicago, he considers himself a Coloradan. Moving to a town near Denver just before he was a teen, he considers himself an outdoorsman through and through. That means backpacking, snowboarding, climbing trees and every sport you can think of. That said, baseball’s his favorite. He spent most of his life around the Denver area, graduating from Colorado State University with a bachelor’s degree in Journalism. Most recently, Jeffrey comes from Rapid City, South Dakota. That’s where he began his career as a reporter covering all kinds of things from a man’s collection of 15,000 hot wheels and a 99-year-old’s first day on the slopes to wildfires, crime, and everything in between. \nEven though being close to the coast is not something he’s familiar with, Jeffrey’s confident the Pacific Northwest is somewhere he’ll feel at home. With some mountains right around the corner, his roots in Colorado don’t seem too far away. Jeffrey’s both excited to start bringing the stories of Oregon to light and to see, but mostly smell, some of the Portland rain he’s heard so much about. He likes the rain.

was born and raised in Arkansas and graduated from the University of Central Arkansas. Go Bears! After deciding to study journalism with an emphasis in broadcast, I worked my way up the ladder at our student-run news station, News6, from reporter to producer to eventually news director. I also covered various sports as a photographer and reporter for our sports journalism program now known as the Purple and Gray Network, including covering our football team when they won the Southland Conference Championship. I’m a huge sports fan and continue to cheer on the Bears from the PNW. \n\nMy first news job was at KPLC and Fox29 in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where I was a reporter and anchor. While there I covered many memorable stories including trying my first crawfish at the annual Crawfish Festival and interviewing then-President Trump during one of his visits to SWLA. \n\nI then moved a few hours north to Shreveport, Louisiana to our sister station KSLA, the CBS-affiliate that covered the ArkLaTex. There I kept the community informed as we entered the unknowns of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted the stories of our area’s veterans and active serving military members in our franchise KSLA Salutes, and covered the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Laura. \n\nMy career has now brought me to the Pacific Northwest, and I cannot be more excited to continue to keep my community informed in Northwest Oregon and Southwest Washington at Fox 12 Oregon. I’m from the Natural State so you can find me checking out all the amazing sights and hikes the PNW has to offer. If you have any recommendations for areas, trails, or restaurants to check out, send them my way!

Marine started as Multimedia Journalist at FOX 12 in June 2020, ready to jump in and cover stories in both Oregon and Washington mid-pandemic and as protests in Portland began.\n\nBefore coming to Oregon, Drew started her career in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where she covered the city council, issues at schools, local elections and a presidential visit to the small city in Southwest Louisiana. During her two years there, she also reported on the fun parts of Louisiana too! Whether it was Mardi Gras or crawfish season, there was no shortage of good food and king cake.\n \nDrew is originally from Southern California. After high school, she went to Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communications in Phoenix (Go Devils!!!) where she was a reporter for the school's daily broadcast on Arizona PBS.\n \nWhen she's not working, she likes to cozy up with her cats Ira and Pod to watch the newest show on Netflix. Since moving to Oregon mid-pandemic, she hasn't gotten to try all the best food spots in town yet. So, if you have any movie or takeout recommendations - she's all ears!

Marine started as Multimedia Journalist at FOX 12 in June 2020, ready to jump in and cover stories in both Oregon and Washington mid-pandemic and as protests in Portland began.\n\nBefore coming to Oregon, Drew started her career in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where she covered the city council, issues at schools, local elections and a presidential visit to the small city in Southwest Louisiana. During her two years there, she also reported on the fun parts of Louisiana too! Whether it was Mardi Gras or crawfish season, there was no shortage of good food and king cake.\n \nDrew is originally from Southern California. After high school, she went to Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communications in Phoenix (Go Devils!!!) where she was a reporter for the school's daily broadcast on Arizona PBS.\n \nWhen she's not working, she likes to cozy up with her cats Ira and Pod to watch the newest show on Netflix. Since moving to Oregon mid-pandemic, she hasn't gotten to try all the best food spots in town yet. So, if you have any movie or takeout recommendations - she's all ears! Feel free to reach out to her with recommendations and story ideas.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"last_updated_date":"2022-11-16T22:27:24.930Z","twitter":"DrewCMarine","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/DrewMarineTV","custom_gray_stationname":"kptv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news"}}},{"_id":"paulina-aguilar","type":"author","version":"0.5.8","name":"Paulina

She joined the team at Fox 12 Oregon in May 2023, and is passionate about telling the stories that matter most to the people in her beloved state.\n\nKarli grew up in the small town of Harrisburg, just north of Eugene. \n\nFrom a young age, it was clear that writing was a core part of her personality. Throughout the years she wrote poems and short stories, self-published three books, and competed in speech competitions. As a teenager, she got her start in journalism writing feature articles for the local newspaper, The Tribune News.\n\nShe earned her BA Communications in 2017 from Thomas Edison State University, and after a brief career in banking, decided that it was just too hard to stay away from the pull of journalism. Karli traveled to Ireland to earn her MA Journalism from the University of Limerick, where she discovered a passion for video storytelling, and she started as an intern at Central Oregon Daily News in Bend, Oregon in 2020. She became the station’s first ever morning show producer, and eventually moved into an on-air reporter role. In 2023, she was nominated for a Northwest Regional Emmy Award in the Multimedia Journalist category.\n\nIn her time away from the newsroom, Karli enjoys traveling, singing, paddle boarding, browsing the aisles of Powell’s Books, baking goodies for the newsroom, and continuing her quest to find the world’s greatest pun.","slug":"","native_app_rendering":false,"fuzzy_match":false,"contributor":false,"status":true,"custom_gray_stationname":"kptv","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","last_updated_date":"2023-06-16T23:48:00.838Z","twitter":"olson_karli","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100089179980796","role":"Reporter"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-06-22T20:57:55.977Z","description":{"basic":"On

was born and raised in Arkansas and graduated from the University of Central Arkansas. Go Bears! After deciding to study journalism with an emphasis in broadcast, I worked my way up the ladder at our student-run news station, News6, from reporter to producer to eventually news director. I also covered various sports as a photographer and reporter for our sports journalism program now known as the Purple and Gray Network, including covering our football team when they won the Southland Conference Championship. I’m a huge sports fan and continue to cheer on the Bears from the PNW. \n\nMy first news job was at KPLC and Fox29 in Lake Charles, Louisiana, where I was a reporter and anchor. While there I covered many memorable stories including trying my first crawfish at the annual Crawfish Festival and interviewing then-President Trump during one of his visits to SWLA. \n\nI then moved a few hours north to Shreveport, Louisiana to our sister station KSLA, the CBS-affiliate that covered the ArkLaTex. There I kept the community informed as we entered the unknowns of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighted the stories of our area’s veterans and active serving military members in our franchise KSLA Salutes, and covered the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Laura. \n\nMy career has now brought me to the Pacific Northwest, and I cannot be more excited to continue to keep my community informed in Northwest Oregon and Southwest Washington at Fox 12 Oregon.
