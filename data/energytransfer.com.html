The project will convert Energy Transfer’s existing Lake Charles LNG import and regasification terminal into a LNG export facility, providing a cost advantage over other proposed LNG projects on the Gulf Coast. The project is fully permitted for three 5.5 MPTA liquefaction trains, which will utilize existing infrastructure. Lake Charles LNG facility will also benefit from abundant natural gas supply and proximity to major pipeline infrastructure, including Energy Transfer’s vast pipeline network. In addition to the existing pipeline infrastructure, the Lake Charles LNG import and regasification terminal has approximately 430,000 cubic meters of above ground LNG storage capacity, two deep water docks capable of handling ships with up to 217,000 cubic meters of capacity, and a deep water turning basin. The project is estimated to create up to 5,000 jobs during construction and 200 full-time positions when fully operational. \u003c/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400; text-align: left;\">For more information: \u003c/span>\u003ca href=\"https://www.energytransferlng.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\">energytransferlng.com\u003c/span>\u003c/a>\r\n\u003c/div>","cta":"","image":false,"smallBottomSpacing":"false","grayBackground":"no","wideLayout":"false"}],"nextPageLink":{"title":"Informational Postings & Customer Activities","url":"/informational-postings/","target":""}},"_links":{"predecessor-version":[{"id":10500,"href":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-json/wp/v2/pages/5126/revisions/10500"}]}},{"id":4205,"date":"2019-04-18T17:21:04","slug":"investor-faq","link":"https://energytransfer.com/investor-faq/","title":{"rendered":"Investor FAQ"},"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"universal-template.php","acf":{"meta_tags":{"meta_title":"Investor FAQ | Energy Transfer","meta_description":"Energy Transfer Investor Relations Frequently Asked Questions"},"flexComponents":[{"acf_fc_layout":"hero","title":"Investor Frequently Asked Questions","subtitle":"","size":"small","image":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3.2-Newsroom-1440px.jpg","imageMobile":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/3.2-Newsroom-600px.jpg","bgImagePosition":"center","overlayImage":false,"overlayClassName":""},{"acf_fc_layout":"accordionBlockWithTitle","title":"FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS","subtitle":"See below for quick answers to many commonly asked questions.","openFirstDrawerOnPageload":true,"accordions":[{"accordionTitle":"What is a Master Limited Partnership (MLP)?","text":"\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Master Limited Partnership (MLP) is a publicly traded partnership.

This allows for a higher potential cash flow payout to unitholders. Instead, each unitholder will be required to report on his or her income tax return his or her share of our income, gains, losses, and deductions without regard to whether corresponding cash distributions are received. As a result, a unitholder’s share of taxable income, and possibly the income tax payable by the unithholder with respect to that income, may exceed the cash actually distributed to the unitholder. Since MLPs generally pay more cash distributions than the amount of taxable income allocated, the tax basis of the unitholder is decreased by the difference between total cash received and taxable income reported. Cash distributions will become taxable if the unitholders’s cost basis is reduced to zero. It is the responsibility of each unitholder to investigate the legal and tax consequences under the law of pertinent states and localities of his or her investment in Energy Transfer.\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Energy Infrastructure Council (&#8220;EIC&#8221;) provides resources on basic partnership tax principles on its webpage \u003ca href=\"https://eic.energy/basic-tax-principles/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">found here\u003c/a>.

unfortunate mischaracterization of the agreement that was filed in open court on Friday. As the Attorney General is aware, and as acknowledged in open court, we pled “Nolo Contendere” (no contest) with no admission to any facts. Additionally, contrary to the Attorney General’s characterization, and as acknowledged by the parties on the record, the $10 million fund which Energy Transfer agreed to establish is not a fine or a penalty of any kind but the product of a voluntary collaboration with the Commonwealth. The same is true for the well-water grievance procedure, which is a voluntary program agreed to by Energy Transfer. The fact remains that the total fines levied were limited to $57,500. While we understand Mr. Shapiro is running for office, it remains disappointing that he would mischaracterize the facts of this voluntary agreement to his political advantage rather than acknowledge the good faith efforts of Energy Transfer to resolve this dispute.\r\n\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; width: 100%; text-align: left; font-color: #FFFFFF;\"> \r\nHaving said that, we are pleased to bring these matters to a close. It is always our priority to work in a manner that lawfully complies with all applicable rules and regulations.

The show cause order alleges that Energy Transfer knowingly added diesel fuel to the drilling mud used in an underground horizontal directional drill. The truth is there is no evidence to show that Energy Transfer or Rover had any knowledge of, or involvement in this action.  \r\nMany months later, Energy Transfer learned that a rogue employee of an independent drilling subcontractor in fact, admitted under oath to having committed this act on his own volition and then tried to hide it. Energy Transfer has cleaned up the area impacted by this diesel fuel, and Energy Transfer believes this area has been restored to a pristine condition. \r\n\tRover has an indemnity agreement in place with the contractor responsible for conducting this directional drill that requires the contractor to pay any assessment or costs related to this incident. Energy Transfer intends to seek full recovery from this contractor for any fine or penalties imposed by the Office of Enforcement.  \r\n\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 22px; width: 100%; text-align: left; font-color: #FFFFFF;\">\u003cstrong>RESPONSE TO CPS ENERGY LAWSUIT\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\r\n\u003cp style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 16px; width: 100%; text-align: left; font-color: #FFFFFF;\">May 11, 2021: “It is now very clear that CPS, unlike many other cities and municipalities, did not properly prepare in advance of the storm to be able to provide electricity to its captive customers throughout the duration of the storm. Now, they are diverting the spotlight from their reckless and incompetent actions in order to avoid paying their bills. CPS is trying to play politics and place blame on others. Due to their miscalculations of the severity of the storm and their lack of competent planning, they needed to purchase natural gas and electricity at the prevailing market prices during the storm in order to meet critical human needs for the citizens of San Antonio. The gas that we sold to CPS was at fully negotiated and transparent pricing. They were not obligated to purchase any gas from us. Yet after agreeing to a fully negotiated price they then received and consumed the gas knowing full well the purchase price in advance. Energy Transfer also allowed CPS to take gas above and beyond volumes CPS agreed to purchase in order to help their customers. It now seems evident that CPS agreed to prices and then received and consumed the natural gas with no intention of honoring the agreement. The facts will clearly show that the citizens of San Antonio deserve better,” said Tom Long and Mackie McCrea, Co-CEOs of Energy Transfer.\u003c/p>","cta":"","image":false,"smallBottomSpacing":"false","grayBackground":"no","wideLayout":"false"},{"acf_fc_layout":"twoColumnGray","title":"","titleAlignment":"left","leftColumn":"\u003cdiv class=\"curatedArticles__articlesSection\">\n\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"/community-news/\">\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2 class=\"statementBlock__title\">Business News\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\n\u003cdiv class=\"curatedArticles__article\" style=\"padding: 6px 0;\">\n\u003cdiv class=\"curatedArticles__articleDate\">02/16/2023\u003c/div>\n\u003cdiv class=\"curatedArticles__articleTitle\" style=\"font-size:16px;\">U.S. LNG Producers Poised to Leapfrog Rivals with Three New Projects\u003c/div>\n\u003cp>\u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/u-s-lng-producers-poised-to-leapfrog-rivals-with-three-new-projects/ar-AA17AeYt\" style=\"font-size:12px;

Land agents are our “boots on the ground” that work with landowners along our pipeline routes to obtain survey permission, negotiate voluntary easement agreements, manage questions and concerns during construction, and ensure the landowner is satisfied through the life of the pipeline. Landowners can contact their land agent any time during construction of a pipeline or throughout its operations. Once a project is complete and in-service, our ROW Team continues to be the primary source for ongoing communication with landowners.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>\u003cbr />\nPublic Affairs\u003c/strong>\u003cbr />\nOur Public Affairs professionals communicate early and often with county and municipal officials, emergency managers, school administrators, and other local management stakeholders. Prior to construction, public affairs liaisons consult with stakeholders to assess potential impacts and bring feedback to the project team for collaborative design and mitigation measures. Liaisons maintain those relationships throughout construction in order to provide updates, answer questions or address concerns.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>\u003cbr />\nGovernment Relations\u003c/strong>\u003cbr />\nOur Government Affairs team engages, develops and maintains relationships with local, state and federal officials in order to share information about proposed and existing company projects, provide feedback on proposed legislation, and discuss broader industry and economic issues. They provide counsel to all levels of Energy Transfer’s organization and support other departments, including Legal, Compliance, and Public Relations, with stakeholder and regulatory engagement, media relations, and employee communications activities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>\u003cbr />\nInvestor Relations\u003c/strong>\u003cbr />\nOur Investor Relations team serves as the bridge between our management team and our key financial stakeholders. They work to maintain an open dialogue and build strong relationships with all of our current and potential investors by providing transparent and timely company\u003cbr />\nupdates. Resources include press releases, quarterly earnings calls and regularly posting investor presentations and SEC filings to our corporate website. Throughout 2021, our investor\u003cbr />\nrelations and executive management teams engaged in numerous investor conferences, meetings and phone calls to discuss Energy Transfer’s goals and key milestones, growth outlook, ESG initiatives, and other current events.\u003c/p>\n","image":{"ID":14531,"id":14531,"title":"Neighbor","filename":"Neighbor.jpg","filesize":48573,"url":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Neighbor.jpg","link":"https://energytransfer.com/public-awareness/neighbor/","alt":"","author":"5","description":"","caption":"","name":"neighbor","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":1522,"date":"2023-02-03 19:26:22","modified":"2023-02-03 19:26:22","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":374,"height":294,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Neighbor.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":118,"medium":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Neighbor.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":236,"medium_large":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Neighbor.jpg","medium_large-width":374,"medium_large-height":294,"large":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Neighbor.jpg","large-width":374,"large-height":294,"1536x1536":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Neighbor.jpg","1536x1536-width":374,"1536x1536-height":294,"2048x2048":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Neighbor.jpg","2048x2048-width":374,"2048x2048-height":294,"post-thumbnail":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Neighbor.jpg","post-thumbnail-width":374,"post-thumbnail-height":294}}},{"name":"COMMUNITY","title":"RESPECT FOR ALL PEOPLE, TRADITIONS AND CULTURES","description":"\u003cp>We believe that creating healthy, strong communities requires a collective commitment to doing what is right.

At Energy Transfer, we believe fossil fuel companies will continue to evolve, as we have always done.

As one of the leading exporters of propane and ethane, we help to significantly reduce global emissions by providing clean-burning fuel as an alternative to diesel and bunker fuel. Developing countries commonly use carbon-dense fuels such as wood, animal waste, coal, diesel and bunker fuel for power generation and residential heating and cooking, and these fuels emit significantly more emissions than propane, ethane or natural gas. Expanded use of natural gas can help improve air quality when it is used to replace less environmentally friendly sources.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>\u003cbr />\nALTERNATIVE ENERGY INITIATIVES\u003c/strong>\u003cbr />\nIn 2021, we formally developed a dedicated group to understand, prepare and innovate as we move toward a lower-carbon future. Energy Transfer’s Alternative Energy Group is focused on pursuing alternative energy projects that complement our existing midstream assets and strives to help reduce our environmental footprint in a manner that makes economic sense. Various opportunities include solar and wind farms (either as a power purchaser or in partnership with third-party developers), as well as renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, forestry carbon credit projects, and carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration. Energy Transfer tapped Tom Mason, Executive Vice President, General Counsel &#038; President LNG, to lead the group.

In fact, the electricity we purchase on any given day originating from solar and wind sources is nearing 20 percent—enough energy to power about 40,000 homes. Since 2019, we have entered into dedicated solar contracts to purchase 148 megawatts of solar power to support the operations of our assets. We also operate approximately 21,000 solar panel-powered metering stations across the United States. \u003c/p>\n","image":{"ID":14464,"id":14464,"title":"Resiliency Section Image","filename":"Resiliency-Section-Image.png","filesize":150172,"url":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Resiliency-Section-Image.png","link":"https://energytransfer.com/corporate-responsibility/resiliency-section-image/","alt":"","author":"5","description":"","caption":"","name":"resiliency-section-image","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":436,"date":"2023-02-02 20:27:35","modified":"2023-02-02 20:27:35","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/png","type":"image","subtype":"png","icon":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":370,"height":295,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Resiliency-Section-Image.png","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":120,"medium":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Resiliency-Section-Image.png","medium-width":300,"medium-height":239,"medium_large":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Resiliency-Section-Image.png","medium_large-width":370,"medium_large-height":295,"large":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Resiliency-Section-Image.png","large-width":370,"large-height":295,"1536x1536":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Resiliency-Section-Image.png","1536x1536-width":370,"1536x1536-height":295,"2048x2048":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Resiliency-Section-Image.png","2048x2048-width":370,"2048x2048-height":295,"post-thumbnail":"https://energytransfer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Resiliency-Section-Image.png","post-thumbnail-width":370,"post-thumbnail-height":295}}},{"name":"ESG","title":"ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL & CORPORATE GOVERNANCE","description":"\u003cp>Energy Transfer is focused on Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) related strategies and objectives that positively impact our employees, operations, unitholders and the communities where we operate.

Some examples include:\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>\u003cbr />\nASSET OPTIMIZATION\u003c/strong>\u003cbr />\nWe have a long history of strategically acquiring companies and consolidating our operations. Asset optimization is the process of identifying and evaluating commercial and operational synergies that enhance the operational capabilities of our systems by capitalizing on improved efficiencies and increasing utilization and profitability of combined assets.

It plays a critical role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. We implement CCS at several of our existing treating and processing facilities, which allowed us to sequester more than 86,328 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2021. We are also actively pursuing numerous other carbon capture and sequestration projects related to our gathering and processing facilities. At our Marcus Hook Terminal, we are working on capturing carbon dioxide from flue gas and delivering it to customers in the food and beverage industries.\u003cbr />\n\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u003cbr />\nOne way we capture carbon is through the process of Acid Gas Injection (AGI). AGI is an environmentally beneficial method of managing acid gas and is essentially the compression of a low-pressure gas stream to sufficient pressure to achieve injection and storage in a deep and secure geologic formation. Acid gas storage wells and related infrastructure must meet rigorous safety design requirements, even beyond those of a normal production or service well. Currently, three of our natural gas processing facilities capture and recover hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from various process streams and inject the gas into permanent geologic storage formations.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>\u003cbr />\nDUAL DRIVE\u003c/strong>\u003cbr />\nIn our natural gas compression business, the use of our patented Dual Drive technology, which offers the ability to switch compression drivers between an electric motor and a natural gas engine, allows us to reduce our emissions of nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds.\u003cbr />\n\u003c/span>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u003cbr />\nThe Dual Drive compression system significantly reduces the burden on the electrical grid during severe weather events and peak usage periods. During the 2021 winter storm in Texas, the technology was instrumental in responding to market conditions by seamlessly transitioning between natural gas and electricity, thereby staying online during freezing conditions. Dual Drive is bridging the gap between utility grid stability and improved air quality through reduced emissions, while at the same time being an energy management tool to control energy costs.

Founded by Jocelyn Sheppard in 2018, the company grows lavender and raises bees on reclaimed coal land, and then turns its harvests into essential oils, body creams, and other wellness products. Her goal is twofold: To provide a viable and economically sustainable path to rehabilitate mining land and to create dignified and above-minimum-wage job opportunities for individuals with barriers to traditional employment.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Lavender is a hardy plant that thrives in the rocky soil typically found on reclaimed coal mine sites. It is drought and pest resistant and requires very little fertilizer. Remediation and testing performed by the mining company ensures that the water and soil on the site are clear of contaminants.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Appalachian Botanical Company currently cultivates 75 acres and has plans to expand. It provides a welcomed opportunity for employment in an area that has seen the loss of many jobs in the coal industry over the last decade.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that nearly four million people die every year from illnesses linked to household air pollution, primarily due to emissions from heating and cooking with energy sources like wood, crop waste, charcoal and dung.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Meanwhile, wealthy nations that have built their economies on oil, natural gas and coal, are calling for dramatic reductions in producing and using these fuels. And major banks that control access to most of the financing worldwide, are making it more difficult for underdeveloped countries to receive support for fossil fuel infrastructure.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>When policies and financing limit the availability of fossil fuels, living standards and economic opportunities are hindered for the world’s poor. Limitations also pose serious geopolitical risks to the United States and allied countries.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>“We are fortunate to have vast reserves of oil and natural gas throughout the United States that can support our domestic energy needs and supply international markets for decades to come,” explains \u003ca href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/kelcy-warren/?sh=5565268d237d\">Kelcy Warren\u003c/a>, \u003ca href=\"https://energytransfer.com/leadership/\">Executive Chairman for Energy Transfer\u003c/a>. “We are proud to be in a position to help these developing countries through our natural gas export operations, and we believe that increasing the availability of natural gas around the world will make the biggest impact on lowering carbon emissions. In total, Energy Transfer exports more natural gas liquids (NGLs) than any other company or country, and our percentage of worldwide NGL exports represents approximately 20% of the world market.”\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>SUPPORTING A DIVERSE ENERGY MIX\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Natural Gas is a critical partner in the development and operation of a broad mix of energy sources. Because of its abundance, natural gas will continue to play a major role in meeting energy needs in the future as the world’s mix of energy resources continue to evolve.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Europe’s energy policies over the last two decades, exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have highlighted the risks of reducing domestical supplies of fossil fuels and relying too heavily on renewable energy sources. There’s a clear solution: Pair existing fossil fuel resources with new technologies to support the development of a broad portfolio of energy resources worldwide.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Enabling additional supplies of clean, affordable, and reliable natural gas to be produced and exported around the world is the most logical and quickest way to reduce emissions while also significantly improving the quality of life for billions of people in developing nations around the world.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>We are lucky as a nation to have access to vast reserves of clean-burning natural gas that can be safely and sustainably produced for decades to come, helping support our economy and the world’s growing need for reliable energy. While it is nice to recognize this as the cold weather sets in, it is an important message that Americans should appreciate all year long. &nbsp;\u003c/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp>As we usher in autumn and enjoy the cooling temperatures, we recognize the importance of energy in our lives from powering our electrical grid to heating our homes and cooking our meals, to the importance of our country’s energy security and the impact of energy on the standard of living of humans globally.

In return, Energy Transfer is happy to help the PGC in reaching its wildlife management goals.”\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Most recently, following right-of-way restoration, Energy Transfer planted special pollinator seed mixes and later installed 153 bee boxes on three State Game Lands in Cambria, Blair and Huntingdon counties. As an effort to increase the population of native bees, the boxes and plantings quickly proved successful in attracting not only a variety of native bees, but a high diversity of butterflies and other insects.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>“With this project spanning four different Game Lands within the Southcentral Region, as well as the decline in pollinators, we thought this would be a good project to try and establish pollinator plots to include the bee blocks,” said Chris Skipper, PGC State Game Warden in the Southcentral Region. “We focused on what type of seed mix would best suit each area and increase the diversity along the length of the project.”\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>The bee boxes resemble bird houses at a quick glance, but they feature many small holes of different sizes to accommodate various bee species. The design, developed out of the Penn State Extension Service, was requested by the PGC for installation on State Game Lands 198, 147 and 118. They were built in a wood shop and installed in April of 2022.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Ryan Ward, Wildlife Biologist with AllStar Ecology, oversaw the construction and installation of the boxes. He explained that they were built for bees that don’t make their own hives, called solitary bees. “They come in and lay eggs in each chamber in the block, fill in with pollen for their pupa to eat, and then seal it off with mud at the end,” Ward explained.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Since the rights of way were already well-established with pollinator plantings, the boxes were utilized almost immediately upon installation.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>“I am very happy with the project overall.&nbsp;\u003ca>There were a lot of moving parts, and the coordination among everyone involved was outstanding,” Skipper said. “In the end, I feel we did the best we could for wildlife and will be monitoring the areas to potentially be a model for future projects.”\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>In some of the same areas as the bee boxes, our environmental team also built massive rock structures to provide roosting habitat for the Eastern small-footed bat, which is listed as a threatened species in Pennsylvania.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>“[The bats] use these structures as summer roosting habitat, where they roost in there during the day and come out at night,” explained Brad Schaeffer, Senior Biologist at Tetra Tech. “We worked with the Game Commission to organize where these are located, and we have installed several across the project.”\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>The structures also provide habitat for the Allegheny woodrat, another state-listed threatened species, as well as timber rattlesnakes and other wildlife.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Tom Boone, the Lead Environmental Inspector overseeing Mariner East restoration on this portion of the pipeline, reflected on the success of these habitat improvement projects. \u003ca>“Seeing the project evolve from bare dirt to full restoration – and the pollinators, the bee boxes, and the different habitats that we’ve been able to provide for wildlife and insects, it’s been a pleasure to be part of this process,”\u003c/a>&nbsp;Boone said.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003chr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003ca id=\"_msocom_1\">\u003c/a>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp>Energy Transfer has worked alongside the Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) for a number of years, successfully coordinating Mariner East pipeline construction beneath the seven State Game Lands and restoring the right-of-way.

Located southwest of Fort Worth, the Godley Plant receives natural gas from our gathering pipelines in North Texas and Oklahoma. It processes the natural gas to remove water and CO2, and then cools the gas to condense liquid hydrocarbons from the natural gas stream. These condensed hydrocarbon liquids (mostly ethane and propane) are then transported by our Lone Star NGL pipeline system to fractionators at our Mont Belvieu Terminal.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>The plant boasts environmental benefits by capturing the remaining residue gas (mainly methane) that is not condensed into NGLs. The residue gas is sent to our Cleburne compressor station for distribution to local DFW customers such as the Wolf Hollow Power Plant that use it as a fuel source for residential and industrial applications.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>The Godley Plant was the second gas processing facility built by Energy Transfer (the first being La Grange Plant in Central Texas) in response to the growing demand in the Fort Worth Basin. The plant’s first cryo unit was put into service in October 2006, followed by a second and third in 2007, and a fourth in 2008. Additional construction included new stabilizer units in 2013 and 2018, and a truck loading rack in 2014.

We respect that Dynegy and Luminant opted not to renew their contracts. However, they are still required to pay us for the services that we provided under those agreements. Furthermore, at their discretion they have taken small amounts of natural gas from our system over the past several weeks as they have needed it.

In the midst of all the hustle, petroleum products play a key role in making our holiday wishes come true.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>From toys and decorations to electronics and clothing, the majority of products you’ll purchase this holiday season are derived from petroleum products. And for items that aren’t directly made of oil or natural gas byproducts, fuel is required at some point in their journey to your home. We all rely on our country’s superhighway of underground pipelines to safely transport the oil and natural gas that is essential to making just about everything we touch.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Let’s consider some specific ways petroleum products are an integral part of our modern way of life:\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Holiday Decorations\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Artificial Christmas tree popularity has dramatically risen due to their convenience and cost efficiency. These life-like trees are made of PVC plastic for durability and fire-retardant properties, and are reused year after year. Often, trees are adorned with shatterproof ornaments and LED string lights made with plastic. Oil and natural gas byproducts are also key components of adhesive tape, wrapping paper, tinsel, ribbon, stockings, Styrofoam, artificial snow/flocking spray, paraffin candle wax, Santa costumes, fragrances, and artificial wreaths.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Holiday Travel\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Traveling to see loved ones over the holidays is always a treat. Whether you travel by car, bus, airplane or train, all transportation requires petroleum products in some form. This includes electric vehicles that rely on charging stations, which are connected to local power grids predominantly supplied by natural gas. In some cities, diesel-powered buses have been retrofitted to run on natural gas which reduces overall emissions. All these modes of transportation are made safer, more efficient and affordable with interior parts made of plastic.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Holiday Toys\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Dolls, balls, toy cars, model trains, toy soldiers and more are commonly made of plastic which is softer than wood or metal, and more flexible. That makes toys safer and lighter. Plastic isn’t just limited to toys for small children, but is also an important component in video game consoles, TVs, cell phones, computers, cameras, and drones. Your holiday shopping might include sports equipment that is made with petroleum products including footballs, yoga mats, golf balls, fishing rods, life jackets, basketballs, golf bags, and more.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Holiday Hosting\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Whether you’re carefully basting your roast turkey or sautéing vegetables on the stove, your holiday meal is cooked with natural gas—either directly from pipelines or through your local power grid.&nbsp;According to the&nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php\">U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\u003c/a>, fossil fuels supplied 60% of U.S. net electricity generation used by Americans in 2020 for dependable heating, air conditioning, lighting, refrigeration, industrial production, and other essential power. Hosting friends and family requires more than just food; there are hundreds of household items made from petroleum products that we rely on such as mattresses, pillows, trash bags, kitchenware, countertops, detergents, shower curtains, toilet seats, mops, deodorant, and much more.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Holiday Energy\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Petroleum products support the use and development of solar and wind energy by providing the fuel source for electricity generation when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. Oil and natural gas are also inextricably linked to the production of wind turbines and solar panels. They not only power the manufacturing plants but are also used as raw materials such as carbon fiber and plastic resin.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>So while you indulge in food, family and other blessings during the holiday, remember to add oil and natural gas to the list of items you are thankful for this season.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\">\u003cimg src=\"blob:https://energytransferfacts.com/6d705cd3-02f4-41ce-a3bb-b6d714693347\" alt=\"\"/>\u003c/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp>It’s that time of year!

America’s Electricity and Supporting Our Modern Lifestyle"},"content":{"rendered":"\r\n\u003cp>Charging your phone, heating a cup of coffee, running a warm bath, and cooking a meal all have one thing in common: electricity. Have you ever stopped to think about how crucial electricity is in our daily lives or, more broadly, consider where it comes from?\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Let’s start with the basics: what is electricity? Electricity is considered a secondary energy source, meaning it is generated from a primary energy source such as fossil fuels—including natural gas, petroleum, nuclear, coal, wind or solar. According to the \u003ca href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php\">U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\u003c/a>, natural gas supplied a record-high 40% of U.S. net electricity generation used by Americans in 2020 for dependable heating, air conditioning, lighting, refrigeration, industrial production, and other essential power. Meanwhile, renewable and nuclear energy accounted for approximately 20% each.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Natural gas is projected by the \u003ca href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2020/10/f79/Natural%20Gas%20Benefits%20Report.pdf\">U.S. Department of Energy\u003c/a> to account for the majority of domestic energy consumption for decades to come. That’s because the United States has abundant deposits of natural gas, importing \u003ca href=\"http://needtoknow.nas.edu/energy/energy-sources/fossil-fuels/\">less than 4%\u003c/a> of the total amount consumed annually, making it affordable and readily available. Domestic production also ensures America’s energy independence from unstable and sometimes unfriendly overseas sources. In addition, power grid infrastructure for natural gas is largely in place, whereas transitioning to an all-renewable system will require a big increase in wind, solar and storage construction projects along with the need for more large interstate transmission lines.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Even as America’s energy consumption continues to rise, increased use of clean-burning natural gas has greatly helped to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to their lowest levels in over 30 years. Since 2005, displacing coal with natural gas has prevented over \u003ca href=\"https://eidclimate.org/natural-gas-climate-change/#:~:text=The%20decline%20was%20driven%20by,renewable%20power%20that%20displaced%20coal.&amp;text=Since%202005%2C%20natural%20gas%20has,carbon%20dioxide%20from%20being%20emitted.\">2 billion\u003c/a> metric tons of carbon dioxide from being emitted into the atmosphere. Natural Gas is also a critical partner in the development and operation of renewable energy sources.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>America’s vast system of underground pipelines connects this abundant supply of natural gas to power plants that supply our electricity grids. The ability of our pipeline network to quickly and affordably deliver these resources to market aids in keeping America’s energy costs down.

It will expand access to Midwestern refined products further eastbound from Pittsburgh, which is the only Pennsylvania market currently accessing this supply, and as far east as the Lehigh Valley and to upstate New York.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Initially, the Greater Reading and Lehigh Valley markets will access these products directly from “off-ramps” from the pipeline, with additional Pennsylvania and upstate New York markets gaining access in the future through continued investment.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Joe Colella is Executive Vice President of business development for Energy Transfer.\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Q: Why is this initiative so important, and what makes it unique?\u003cbr>\u003c/strong>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong>&nbsp;Increasing our region’s access to refined products is crucial, which we recently saw when the Colonial Pipeline was temporarily shut down after a cybersecurity breach. With 45% of the East Coast relying on that single pipeline for its fuel, all coming from the Gulf Coast, an interruption in service could unquestionably have a major regional impact. Fortunately, the incident was relatively brief and without long-term effects, but it emphasized our need to diversify our supply. In the future, Pennsylvania Access will be able to provide backup supply for other pipelines such as Colonial, and we’ll be able to deliver supply from the Midwest. This helps reduce our reliance on the Gulf Coast, as well as imports from Europe.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>What makes this unique is the flexibility of Energy Transfer’s pipeline system and our ability to adapt to meet market demand. The current 8-inch Mariner East 1 (ME1) pipeline, which was recently taken out of natural gas liquids (NGL) service through Berks County in preparation for Pennsylvania Access, originally transported refined products&nbsp;\u003cem>from\u003c/em>&nbsp;the Delaware River&nbsp;\u003cem>westward\u003c/em>&nbsp;in the opposite direction. It was converted to NGL service and reversed direction in 2014 to transport NGLs like ethane, propane and butane — the building blocks of many of the household and health care products we rely on every day — while Mariner East 2 (ME2) was being built. Now that ME2 is nearing completion, we’re able to adapt to meet seasonal market demand for Midwest product evacuation and return ME1 to refined products service across most of the state, providing Pennsylvania and New York access to seasonal surpluses of fuel in the Midwest, while improving the overall security of fuel supply to the region.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>While these changes in service require some work to modify and reconnect existing equipment along the pipeline, they do not require any new infrastructure to be built, and all of this work is being done on property owned and operated by Sunoco Pipeline LP.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Q: How will this benefit Pennsylvanians and others in the Northeast?\u003cbr>\u003c/strong>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong>&nbsp;The closure and sale of the former PES Refinery in Philadelphia in 2019 increased the need to import fuel from Canada, Europe and the Gulf Coast, and currently volumes of these products are being imported from Europe to satisfy demand in the Northeast. And as I mentioned, 45% of the East Coast currently relies on the Colonial Pipeline and supply from the Gulf Coast for its fuel. Now, Pennsylvania Access will increase access to Midwest refineries and bolster our security of supply.&nbsp;\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Overall, completing Mariner East pipeline construction and transitioning to refined products service on the 8-inch line, as well as the ongoing NGL development at the Marcus Hook Industrial Complex, will have a significant economic impact in Pennsylvania. Energy Transfer will continue to inject revenue, add jobs and generate tax revenue across the state, all while giving Pennsylvanians and New Yorkers access to the fuels and products they depend on at better prices, with a greater degree of security of supply.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Q: When will the first phase of the initiative be finished?\u003cbr>\u003c/strong>\u003cstrong>A:\u003c/strong>&nbsp;Most of the work required for this change is complete, and we anticipate a third-quarter startup this year for early volumes to be able to flow further eastbound from Pittsburgh to Berks County and into New York.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>For more information about Pennsylvania Access, including the ways Energy Transfer goes above and beyond pipeline safety requirements, please visit \u003ca href=\"http://www.pennsylvaniaaccess.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">www.pennsylvaniaaccess.com\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\">\u003cimg src=\"https://energytransferfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ET-Northeast-Assets-Map_6.15.20-1024x791.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-653\"/>\u003c/figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp>Energy Transfer recently shared updates about our&nbsp;Pennsylvania Access&nbsp;initiative, which will bring refined products like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from Midwest supply regions eastbound through Pennsylvania and north into New York.

Value in First Responder Pipeline Safety Trainings"},"content":{"rendered":"\r\n\u003cp>By Greg Noll\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Building relationships between emergency planners and first responders is critical in any community, and especially related to hazardous materials. This has been an integral part of my career as both a first responder and a hazardous materials emergency response instructor. With several millions of miles of pipelines across the United States, used to transport and deliver various energy products like refined petroleum products, natural gas liquids, and crude oil, my instruction naturally includes response to potential pipeline incidents.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>An important fact that is lost on many people, especially in this day and age, is just how safe pipelines are when compared to other modes of transportation used to deliver energy resources. The U.S. Department of Transportation continues to acknowledge pipelines as the safest mode of energy transportation, and each major pipeline, such as Mariner East 2, can take thousands of cargo tank trucks off the roads and tank cars off the railroads.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Pipeline operators work with first responders in the communities where they operate to organize trainings, tabletop exercises, facility tours, and other events to prepare for the rare event of an incident. Energy Transfer and Sunoco Pipeline have always prioritized this and have thus built close relationships with first responders where they operate. I know this firsthand as I have been involved in this process since 2017.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>The Mariner Emergency Responder Outreach (MERO) Program was developed in 2013 to provide emergency responder training on responding to NGL incidents along the Mariner East and West rights-of-way and in the communities surrounding the pipelines. Preparedness activities have included providing emergency responder training, hosting tours of facilities and assets, sending public information mailers, participating in other community events, and sharing information about projects with those who are interested.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Based on my background as both a first responder and instructor in hazardous materials emergency response, Energy Transfer tapped me in 2017 to deliver the MERO Pipeline Emergencies training sessions in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia. As of this date we have trained more than 2,540 first responders across the Mariners East and West. We are currently in the middle of another round of MERO trainings and I am enjoying the opportunity to teach this valuable material to even more emergency responders.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>First responders already have Awareness and Operations-level training in hazardous materials emergency response. The MERO training builds upon that base and complements their hazmat training by focusing upon pipeline issues and topics, such as the types of pipelines and their operations (e.g., gathering, distribution, transmission), their location within the community, the physical and chemical properties of the products being transported, and the application of a risk-based response process for managing various pipeline incident scenarios should an incident occur.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>The MERO curriculum is based upon the \u003cem>Pipeline Emergencies\u003c/em> (PE) textbook published by the National Association of State Fire Marshals (NASFM). As one of the co-authors of the PE textbook, the textbook has significant third-party review with over 30 technical reviewers representing both the fire service and the pipeline industry. As we say, it’s written by emergency responders, for emergency responders. Now in its third edition, we continue to update the textbook based on new and relevant information, as well as to refresh our pipeline safety trainings.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>As a student of leadership, one of my favorite things to do at each session is to give a shout-out to the “most experienced” (oldest) first responder in the room and introduce them to the youngest and newest. Besides hopefully starting a mentorship between them, the session provides them with the technical information to “make a difference” should an incident occur.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>In closing, I have an agenda in being part of the MERO Program – to keep emergency responders and their communities safe in the event of a pipeline incident. I am honored to play a role in the education of thousands of first responders, and therefore the safety in all of the communities they serve. I hope people keep in mind that pipelines are by far the safest way to transport energy, and incidents are very rare. Rest assured that your local emergency responders are educated and prepared to respond in such a case, and ready to protect and serve.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>&#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003cem>Greg Noll has facilitated MERO trainings across his home state of Pennsylvania for the last four years.

Army Corps of Engineers completes a new environmental report on the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL) in North Dakota, there’s new research showing that shuttering the pipeline would cut oil production from the prolific Bakken shale region, kill thousands of jobs and cost state and local governments millions in tax revenues generated by energy production.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>The environmental effects of Dakota Access’ crossing under Lake Oahe are being studied anew after the corps was ordered to do so by a federal court. The review is expected to take 13 months. Although legal challenges surrounding DAPL are pending, an&nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/appeals-court-allows-dakota-access-pipeline-to-continue-operating-11596662661\">appeals court\u003c/a>&nbsp;overturned the lower court’s order to halt operations and empty the pipeline while the environmental review is ongoing.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>While we all wait for the review, an&nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://www.api.org/~/media/Files/Policy/Infrastructure/2020/API-DAPL-Shutdown-Impacts-Memo.pdf\">ICF analysis\u003c/a>&nbsp;commissioned by API shows what halting Dakota Access operations would mean to production and economies. If Dakota Access were shut down, the analysis found:\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cul>\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Oil production&nbsp;\u003c/strong>– In a shutdown scenario, about 115 million barrels of crude oil would not be produced, with corresponding output losses of associated natural gas and natural gas liquids.\u003c/li>\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Jobs and drilling activity –&nbsp;\u003c/strong>Average loss of 3,000 direct upstream jobs in an initial shutdown period, resulting from depressed drilling activity and other industry investments. Job losses increase to 4,900 when indirect jobs in other sectors related to oil and natural gas production – steel workers who make drilling pipe, workers who mine fracking sand and others – are included and 7,400 when counting direct jobs, indirect jobs and induced jobs supported by the spending of direct and indirect workers in the economy, such as restaurants, grocery stores and others.\u003c/li>\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Tax revenues&nbsp;\u003c/strong>– Loss of $852 million in state production taxes to North Dakota and Montana, plus $69 million in income taxes paid by oil and natural gas companies to the two states.

Alliance\u003c/a>\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>The spread of the novel coronavirus and the subsequent lockdowns has taught us a lot about ourselves, our lifestyles and our habits, but also how we value safety. Safety has become the number one priority for families, businesses and governments looking to keep friends and loved ones from getting sick. Largely, we’ve managed to keep the majority of our communities safe through the use of basic essentials like cleaning products, packaging, medical equipment and personal protective equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Can you guess what all of these things have in common? Plastic made from petroleum-based byproducts.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Although some have attempted to make plastic controversial, there is no denying that it is an essential material and provides tremendous opportunities for inexpensive and life-altering inventions – many of which we are using now to keep us safe during this pandemic such as plastic eyewear, face shields, and many single-use medical items.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Despite how you feel about plastic, it has proven to be a priceless commodity during the pandemic. Plastic and the by-products that make it have revolutionized the ways we redefined safety, equity and design. Plastic has allowed us to create products that are safer, lighter, more affordable and more accessible during this challenging time.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Because nobody is exactly sure how the virus spreads, what treatments work to control or kill it, or how it will effect various individuals, everyone is taking the maximum amount of precaution in their own ways. Though these efforts might vary from person to person, many involve using tried and true products we know and trust that are derived from natural gas and crude oil byproducts.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Many places have made it mandatory for businesses to clean and disinfect everything before the next person is accommodated. You see it everywhere from restaurants and hair salons to aircraft and outdoor recreation equipment. We are also doing it more often at home, cleaning things like doorknobs, light switches and phones, and washing our hands more thoroughly. Antibacterial cleaning products are derived from petrochemicals obtained from refining petroleum and natural gas. They have helped reduce the spread, limit unnecessary contact with the virus, and give us some peace of mind.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Doctors, nurses and other essential workers are using personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks, gloves, eye protection and gowns when treating sick patients or working where there could be contaminated surfaces. In hospitals, plastics become even more important for the sickest patients who require respirators or ventilators to get better. These types of plastic are medical grade and prevent viruses and bacteria from settling on the surface or in the crevices of the tubing enclosures like central lines that are often seen being used for patients in Intensive Care Units (ICU).\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Many cities across the U.S. have made it mandatory to wear protective masks in public places. Whether the mask is homemade out of synthetic fabrics or is the N95 version, they all are made of materials manufactured using natural gas and petroleum.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Businesses are working hard to ensure public safety by using more to-go packaging which ultimately doesn’t have to be handled or washed. In restaurants, food is being prepped and packaged to seal off any contamination that could occur in transport. This has always been done on a larger scale for \u003ca href=\"https://consumerenergyalliance.org/2019/09/whats-your-solution-for-food-safety/\">food delivered to our grocery stores\u003c/a>, using plastic wrap to keep food safe and fresh along the way. Because of all the unknowns, many grocery stores are forbidding reusable bags since it is unclear what a person has touched or what has been in the bag that could ultimately put their staff at risk.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Because of this, even governments are reconsidering \u003ca href=\"https://secure-web.cisco.com/1FxIa0nh_Ry0K5bzbyCpF71df4oUFYu7D_ZE9V75soLlKPgI9Q5RIx22SvzdIv4JUI4cQ9tB-nM3v8Q0zThVT1ntL373aMBCSee82q1yB233ptRSRoZfwmNTEG7llfXhWPGYA6OvORH3be7jgqkmzubjPZj7OBTJ3B1JLY3AFpTA0b0ixZMvsXORZ36gDFKXI6f_uJllRGLtJJYJVrgui5IAYIuvSdU4XzzeWKWPuJfUO_tqFMpW52e_oDRjSMq1w0q676btjioek9nrdIWZTCQ/https%3A%2F%2Fconsumerenergyalliance.org%2F2020%2F04%2Fsingle-use-plastic-is-helping-to-prevent-the-spread-of-coronavirus-should-we-be-banning-it%2F\">single-use plastic\u003c/a>.

The state leads the Midwest in refining capacity and is home to the Patoka Terminal, one of the busiest crude oil storage hubs in the region. Pipelines that connect into the Patoka Terminal supply crude oil to multiple refineries in Illinois and across the Midwest, as well as refineries along the Gulf Coast.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>The Patoka Terminal is a crossroads for pipelines in southern Illinois where crude oil is stored and then delivered to refineries. The Patoka Terminal hosts nearly 80 storage tanks, with a total storage capacity of more than 19 million barrels. \u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Marion County, home to the Patoka Terminal, has a long history as an important intersection for our nation’s oil industry. Some of the first oil wells in Illinois were drilled nearby in the 1860s, and advances in technology led to a sharp increase in Illinois production in the late 1930s. By 1938, the Salem Oil Field was established in Marion County and became the epicenter of the Illinois oil boom. The Salem Oil Field produced 93 million barrels in its second year in operation.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Over the years, pipelines and storage tanks were built in Marion County, and the Patoka Terminal emerged as an important Midwest hub.

We have mailed more than 324,000 public awareness brochures to\r\nresidents, businesses, churches, farmers, schools, public and emergency officials,\r\nexcavators and others along our ME1 and ME2 pipelines since September\r\n2018.&nbsp; \u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>We provide information and training to the local emergency\r\nresponse departments in each county. This includes our MERO sessions and the\r\nco-hosted CoRE trainings. Additionally, we have held more than 100 emergency\r\npreparedness meetings with multiple stakeholder groups along our route\r\n(including emergency response departments and schools) since the project was\r\nannounced in 2014. That includes meetings with over 40 schools that are in the\r\nvicinity of ME1 and ME2 to discuss emergency response planning. As has been the\r\ncase since Sunoco first began operating in the Commonwealth decades ago, safety\r\nis our first priority: the safety of the community, the safety of the environment\r\nand the safety of our operations.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Note: The API standard for timing of Public Awareness\r\nmailings is as follows; mail to Affected Public (residents, farmers,\r\nbusinesses, schools, hospitals, churches, etc.) every two years, mail to\r\nExcavators and Emergency Officials annually, and mail to Public Officials once\r\nevery three years.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Q: What information has Energy Transfer provided to the\r\nPA PUC about pipeline safety and emergency planning for the Mariner East\r\npipelines?\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>A: We provided the PA PUC with our Facility Response Plan\r\n(FRP), which is a more detailed version of an Emergency Response Plan and\r\nincludes all of our assets. We have also provided them with our Public\r\nAwareness Plan, which the PUC previously acknowledged are compliant with all\r\nappropriate rules and regulations. The Public Awareness Plan includes\r\ninformation on our emergency training programs and public communication\r\nplatforms.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Q: What is the emergency evacuation plan for residents\r\nalong Mariner East pipelines?\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>A: Evacuation plans are developed and coordinated by the appropriate local emergency response department as they are municipality-specific. In fact, the decisions regarding evacuations or shelter-in-place can only be ordered by government agencies. Our role in the process, as determined by state or federal regulations, is to provide emergency response departments with the proper training and information that will allow them to develop these plans, which we have done. Regardless of the type of incident—house fire, flood, pipeline or other, first responders are trained how to help people with different circumstances. Safety has always been our first priority: the safety of the community, the safety of the environment and the safety of our operations.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Q: What information is shared with first responders to\r\ninform them about accident response?\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>A: In our MERO sessions with local emergency responders we\r\nprovide information about NGL products, pipeline operations and valve\r\nlocations, along with a number of incident scenarios. We also provide\r\ninformation on possible emergency response procedures based on PHMSA’s\r\nEmergency Response Guidebook. It’s important to note that this guidebook is\r\ntypically found in all public emergency response vehicles nationwide. First\r\nresponders’ role is to assess community safety, secure the area, and initiate\r\ntheir emergency response plan which may include evacuation, shelter-in-place,\r\nor a combination of both. Each county develops its own county-specific\r\nemergency response plan.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>We have and will continue to work with county emergency\r\nresponse departments to provide the information and training they need to\r\ndevelop the appropriate emergency preparedness plans for their areas.\r\nAdditionally, local emergency response departments are able to request from\r\nPHMSA a copy of our Facility Response Plan (FRP).

Our emergency response professionals work and train with local first responders and county emergency services officials to ensure a coordinated response. In fact, a total of 2,018 emergency responders from Pennsylvania attended one of our 71 Mariner Emergency Response Outreach (MERO) sessions since 2013.&nbsp; Through our MERO program, we meet with emergency responders in all the counties we pass through to train them on the products we transport and assist them in refining their own emergency response plans. Our MERO program is based off the content in the Pipeline Emergencies curriculum, which can be found for free online. The Pipeline Emergencies curriculum is a national curriculum that was developed by both the PHMSA and the pipeline industry to provide a uniform curriculum for the delivery of pipeline emergencies training.\u003c/p>\n\n\n\n\u003cp>We\nalso take part in the annual Paradigm meetings with first responders which\ninclude a coordinated response exercise, or CoRE. Last year, 2,027 people\nattended the Paradigm meetings in Pennsylvania, including 1,354 emergency\nresponders. Meetings for 2019 will be conducted this fall.\u003c/p>\n\n\n\n\u003cp>There\nis also the Pennsylvania Pipeline Emergency Response Initiative (PERI) which is\na PHMSA-developed program to advance the abilities of emergency responders to\nplan, manage and train for pipeline emergencies through improved training,\ncooperation and communication with pipeline operators. \u003c/p>\n\n\n\n\u003cp>Under\nPennsylvania regulations, each county emergency management agency is\nresponsible for the development of a county-level emergency operations plan.\nThe information we provided in the MERO program contains key elements in the\ndevelopment of an emergency plan, and includes public protective action\noptions.\u003c/p>\n\n\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>\u003cem>Claim: “The operator should pay for\nthe development of early-detection and warning systems, including an alarm\nsystem.”\u003c/em>\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\n\n\n\u003cp>FACT:\nWe have long had warning and early-detection systems in place that monitor any\nvariances in pressure, temperature, flow rate, and more. If a variance is\ndetected, our sophisticated computational pipeline monitoring (CPM) system\nalerts trained personnel and computerized valves are closed immediately. We\nquickly dispatch trained personnel to the location and notify local emergency\nresponders. \u003c/p>\n\n\n\n\u003cp>According\nto John Zurcher who is an expert in pipeline integrity and was formerly the\nchairman of the Gas Research Institute and helped write many regulatory\nstandards, public detection systems and alarms have proven to not work. He says\ngas detectors are unreliable for many reasons. They can be incorrectly set off\nby detecting methane from cows, gas from the sewer or gas produced by swamps,\nand diesel from idling trucks or a train going by, to name a few. The\ninadvertent triggering of these devices could set off false alarms everywhere\nall the time. False alarms could cause panic and put people in unnecessary\ndanger prior to first responders being able to execute proper protocol. Separately,\nadding odorant to transmission pipelines is not of value as determined by both\nPHMSA and the NTSB. Odorant in pipelines is sulphur-based which can be\ncorrosive to the internal surfaces of the pipe. \u003c/p>\n\n\n\n\u003cp>Our\nsophisticated early-detection systems are installed on all pipelines and\nmonitored 24/7 by specially trained personnel. We are able to close valves\nquickly and coordinate an appropriate response with local emergency responders.\nSafety is the utmost importance to us which is why we exceed regulatory\nstandards for pipeline safety inspections.

Misinformation About Our Mariner East Pipelines"},"content":{"rendered":"\n\u003cp>In a recent Letter to the Editor in Chester County’s Daily Local\nNews, there was misinformation about our Mariner East Pipeline system. Let’s\nset the record straight. The following points refute exact wording from the\nLetter. \u003c/p>\n\n\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CLAIM: “The operator should pay for a total and complete hazard and environmental risk assessment.”\u003c/strong>\u003cbr>FACT: &nbsp;We have conducted all the required assessments of this pipeline in coordination with the appropriate regulatory bodies. Environmental assessments are part of our filings with the DEP and Army Corps of Engineers. &nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\n\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CLAIM: “The operator should pay for the development of early detection and warning systems.”\u003c/strong>\u003cbr>FACT: &nbsp;Way ahead of you here. We have long had warning and early detection systems in place that monitor any variances in pressure, temperature, flowrate, product type and more. If a variance is detected, our sophisticated Computational Pipeline Monitoring (CPM) system alerts trained personnel and computerized values are closed immediately. \u003c/p>\n\n\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CLAIM: “The operator should pay for public awareness programs.”\u003c/strong>\u003cbr>FACT: We have a robust Public Awareness Program that includes annual mailing of safety brochures to all parties along the pipeline route, using the same wording as PHMSA, explaining how to identify and react to a pipeline emergency. We follow the requirements of CFR 195.440 which states that all pipeline operators must develop and implement a written continuing public education program that follows the guidance provided in the American Petroleum Institute’s (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 1162. We are also a member of Pennsylvania 811 that publishes a version for kids. \u003c/p>\n\n\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CLAIM: “The operator should pay for evacuation plans.”\u003c/strong>\u003cbr>FACT: Each county’s emergency response department develops its own preparedness and evacuation plans. We have trained more than 2,000 first responders, offered annual training to civil authorities, and met with school officials to provide information and training. We ARE doing our part and go above and beyond federal requirements to ensure public safety. Recently at a House Committee hearing, David Padfield from the PA Emergency Management Agency said that the agency has reviewed every county’s emergency response plans to ensure they are adequate. \u003c/p>\n\n\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CLAIM: “The operator should pay for proper equipment and training for our first responders.”\u003c/strong>\u003cbr>FACT: &nbsp;Did you know we have donated more than $1 million to first responder departments across Pennsylvania to help provide equipment and training? We work and train with local first responders and county emergency services officials to ensure a coordinated response.\u003c/p>\n\n\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CLAIM: “Pipeline development degrades economic vitality.”\u003c/strong>\u003cbr>FACT: Completely false. Oil and gas has been one of the biggest contributors to Pennsylvania’s economy since the 1850’s. Pipelines mean well-paying jobs, home energy savings, and literally millions pouring back in to the local economy. \u003c/p>\n\n\n\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>CLAIM: “The pipeline development costs the taxpayers money to prepare and mitigate.”\u003c/strong>\u003cbr>FACT: We pay for it all.

Using advanced technology and a proven safety design, Mariner East 2 has added features that exceed federal requirements.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), along with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC), oversees the safe operation of pipelines. (Pipeline safety standards are found in the Code of Federal Regulations, specifically 49 CFR 195.) These regulations require enhanced protection for defined High Consequence Areas (HCA) areas, which include urbanized areas delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau, Unusually Sensitive Areas (USAs), and commercially navigable waterways.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>One of the measures used to protect HCAs is to upgrade existing main line valves or add new valves to act as emergency flow restriction devices (EFRDs). Such valves can be controlled remotely by the pipeline control center at all times. Some EFRD valves can automatically close in response to changes in pressure that could signal a problem with the pipeline system and trigger a systemwide shutdown. EFRD valves are placed strategically along the pipeline as determined via risk analysis evaluations to minimize potential impact to HCAs in the event of a pipeline emergency.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Pipelines regulated under 49 CFR 195 are assessed for integrity at least once every five years. These assessments are carried out via the use of in-line inspection tools or via a hydrostatic pressure test. The technologically sophisticated in-line inspection tools have the ability to detect conditions on the pipeline that require repair. Necessary repairs are identified along the length of the pipelines, with priority given to those repairs located within HCAs in accordance with federal regulations. Hydrostatic pressure testing involves filling the pipeline with water and pressurizing that water above the pipeline’s maximum operating pressure. Pressure testing has the ability to identify critical flaws that require repair prior to refilling the pipeline. It also provides a safety buffer between the test pressure and operating pressure of the system during transportation of hazardous liquids.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Energy Transfer exceeds requirements for inspecting our pipeline rights-of-way by conducting frequent ground and aerial patrols. The patrols monitor for any activity on the pipeline rights-of-way and for other conditions that could impact pipeline and public safety. Aerial patrols are targeted to be performed at least weekly, weather permitting.\u003c/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u003cp>Please see additional information on ways that the Mariner East 2 Pipeline exceeds regulatory standards, visit:  \u003cbr>\u003ca href=\"https://marinerpipelinefacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ME2-Above-and-Beyond-2-5-18.pdf\">https://marinerpipelinefacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ME2-Above-and-Beyond-2-5-18.pdf\u003c/a> \u003c/p>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"\u003cp>Safety is a top priority at Energy Transfer &#8212; the safety of our people, our communities and our environment.
