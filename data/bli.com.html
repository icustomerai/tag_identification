	<h2>Company History: </h2>
  <p><strong>1992</strong> - Bussan Logistics Inc. was established as a strategic U.S. based subsidiary of Mitsui & Co. Ltd. to operate and manage specialized fresh daily-to-store combined distribution centers in the U.S. for 7-Eleven, Inc.  Bussan Logisticâs parent company, Mitsui & Co. Ltd. is a long-time global alliance partner of 7-Eleven, Inc.âs parent company, 7 & I Holdings of Tokyo, Japan.  Mitsui & Co. Ltd. was able to leverage its significant experience in successfully operating similar fresh daily-to-store distribution centers for 7-Eleven stores in Japan.  In order to highlight the connection to its parent company, Bussan Logistics, Inc. later changed its name to Mitsui Bussan Logistics, Inc. (MBLI). </h5>  
  <p><strong>1995</strong> - A separate company, Mitsui Supply Systems, Inc. (âMSSIâ), was created to provide customized demand chain management services exclusively to 7-Eleven, Inc. stores throughout the U.S. and Canada.  Initially, MSSI handled only food packaging and supply item fulfillment and distribution, but eventually expanded its DCM services to cover a much broader range of products using more sophisticated DCM management tools and methods.</p>
  <p><strong>2000</strong> â MSSI was merged into MBLI in order to capitalize on synergies and reduce the operating costs of both companies.</p>
  <p><strong>2012 & Beyond</strong> â MBLI embarks upon a strategic objective to expand its cost reducing DCM and logistics service offerings to a broader range of retailers and wholesale distributors.</p>

								<h2 class="major">About MBLI's Demand Chain</h2>
								<h2 class="major">Management Service (DCM)</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<h2>What is DCM?</h2>
  <p><p>Retailers continue to assign increasing importance to achieving strong in-stock performance, low levels of inventory, and decreased risk of inventory obsolescence while simultaneously offering expanded and unique product offerings.  Compounding the challenges presented by these retail objectives, product supply chains have grown in complexity and also in their sensitivity to customer and product trends, with many retailers placing stronger emphasis on the importance of their own higher margin proprietary and private label product offerings.  Such a merchandising strategy results in higher exposure to out-of-stocks, obsolete inventory, and increased logistics expenses.  Nevertheless, new, different, and unique remain the primary merchandising goals of most convenience retailers today.</p>
<p><ul class="listDot">Through its  partnerships with convenience store operators and foodservice wholesale  distributors, Mitsui Bussan Logistics, Inc. (MBLI) has developed and refined the  methods, systems, and business processes utilized to help product supply chains  gain flexibility and responsiveness, while improving performance in key supply  chain metrics, and lowering costs.  Ultimately,  MBLI seeks to provide convenience retailers and their upstream partners with <u>concurrent  improvements in</u>:</p>
  <ul class="listDot">
  <li>Wholesale and retail in-stock %</li>
  <li>Upstream logistics expenses</li>
  <li>Overall inventory levels</li>
  <li>Inventory obsolescence rates</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the  illustration below for a depiction of MBLI&rsquo;s demand chain service objective.</p>
<p> <a href="images/DCMTarget.png" target ="blank" class="popup-img"><img src="Images/DCMTarget.png"  width="400" height="320"alt="DCM Target" /></a></p>
<h2>How Does MBLI Deliver Its DCM Service?</h2>
  <p>From its  operations center in Dallas, Texas MSSI micro-manages and regulates the flow of  products originating from both domestic and off-shore sources and through a network  of unique distribution channels. MSSI uses customized software and proprietary business methods  along with VMI and EDI based connectivity to enable effective DCM.   Facilitating logistics savings and efficiency, MSSI operates several strategically  located &ldquo;Transfer Centers,&rdquo; which are used to provide efficient truckload  consolidation of products for which direct-to-distributor shipments are not  cost-effective.  Transfer Centers also  serve as rapid replenishment points to quickly respond to the inevitable  volatility of customer demand.  These multi-purpose  Transfer Centers play an important role in delivering MSSI&rsquo;s cost saving DCM  service.</p>
  <p ul class="listDot">Specifically, MBLI&rsquo;s DCM service encompasses the  following activities:</p>
  <ul class="listDot">
    <li>Item level forecast and production collaboration,  including lifecycle planning</li>
    <li>Order planning and inventory replenishment (both  VMI /EDI and other methods)</li>
    <li>Daily micro-management of inventory positions and  movements</li>
    <li>Efficient utilization of Transfer Centers for the  recombination of inbound and outbound truckloads</li>
    <li>Robust item registration verification protocols </li>
    <li>Tactical management of supplier relationships </li>
    <li>Detailed tracking and reporting of excess and  slow moving inventory </li>
    <li>Upstream transportation and logistics coordination,  including reverse movements as requested</li>
    <li>Delivery coordination, monitoring, and proactive  trouble-shooting</li>
    <li>Transaction verification and settlement among  partners</li>
    <li>Proactively communicating critical product and  promotional dependencies and issues</li>
  </ul>
