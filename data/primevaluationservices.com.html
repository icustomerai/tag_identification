          <h2>WHO WE ARE...</h2>
		  <p>
Prime Valuation Services, Inc (PVS) is a seasoned inspection company 
specializing in working with insurance providers to deliver a wide range of 
services with an emphasis on quality.  Our growth and success has been largely 
based on the quality and accuracy of our reporting.  The two main contributors 
to the high quality of our reports are the inspectors we use and the attention 
to detail from our review staff.  The difference between us and our competitors 
is that we review each and every report before it leaves our office.  
We have been told on multiple occasions from clients that our attention to detail 
is like no other in the industry.

          <h2>WHAT WE DO...</h2>
		  <p>
We provide each of our clients with a cost-effective, professional report 
that will enhance their portfolio, lower their risk and ensure a long lasting 
relationship; not only with the insured, but with the agent as well.  PVS has an 
experienced staff that uses the latest technology along with an intimate knowledge
 of insurable costs necessary to produce credible, reliable insurance reports.  
 Our inspectors work directly for PVS, with a large number being real estate 
 appraisers; all are familiar with property inspections, insurable replacement 
 costs and report writing.  Each inspector is trained specifically for insurance 
 underwriting needs.  The technology used by PVS offers a wide range of quality 
 products and reports tailored to each clientâs needs; designed to seamlessly 
 integrate with any technology used; delivered electronically, on-time and with 
 easily recognized benefits.

          <h2>WHY WE ARE DIFFERENT...</h2>
		  <p>
Prime Valuation Services, Inc. uses local area inspectors, 
so the insured and/or insurance agent can take comfort that a knowledgeable, 
local inspector is handling the information on their policy.  PVS has an expertise
 in high risk liability conditions to assure appropriate coverage and avoid costly
 claims.  All of our inspectors present themselves professionally, including 
 appropriate attire, have identification, and have documentation in relationship
 to your specific policy and insurance coverage.  Our reports make use of as many
 photos as necessary, along with written descriptions to clearly and accurately 
 describe sub-standard conditions.  Multiple photos are at no additional cost to 
 our clients.  The replacement cost developed by PVS is exact and ensures that our 
 clients can have full confidence in their accuracy when presenting a report to either
 an agent or the insured.
