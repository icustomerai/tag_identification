During uncertainty like this, it\u2019s normal to think about the plans you have in place to keep your family secure \u2013 including life insurance. Whether you\u2019re thinking about purchasing life insurance in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak or wondering what your current policy covers, here\u2019s what to know.\r\n<h2>How can I keep myself and my family safe during the coronavirus outbreak?<\/h2>\r\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the novel coronavirus a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/goatsandsoda\/2020\/03\/11\/814474930\/coronavirus-covid-19-is-now-officially-a-pandemic-who-says\">global pandemic<\/a> \u2013 the first since the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) virus.\u00a0The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that older people and those with underlying health conditions, like heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/summary.html\">are at greater risk for developing serious symptoms<\/a>.\r\n\r\nTo help keep your home safe and healthy, the CDC recommends the following preventative steps:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Avoid touching your face<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Ensure your home stays sanitized and clean<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Stay home if you are sick<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Follow CDC guidance about closures and avoiding crowds<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWith the announcement of the travel ban to Europe for at least 30 days, it\u2019s also important to be aware of existing travel restrictions designed to prevent the disease from spreading. If you need to travel, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/protect\/index.html\">carry hand sanitizer and extra disinfectant wipes<\/a> to wipe down surfaces you come into contact with. Also, be prepared to be away from home for longer than expected if you get sick or need to be quarantined.\r\n<h2>Is now a good time to buy life insurance?<\/h2>\r\nIn general, sooner rather than later is always better when it comes to buying life insurance. The younger you are, the less expensive your policy typically is. It also means you\u2019re protected in case you develop a condition later in life that would prevent you from qualifying.\r\n\r\nIf the outbreak has you thinking about protecting your family financially, it\u2019s important to be aware of certain recent changes because of coronavirus:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>New travel restrictions.<\/strong> Insurance carriers are taking a close look at countries that were never considered travel risks before, like Italy, where the outbreak has been particularly severe. When you apply, your insurance company will likely ask you about where you\u2019ve traveled recently. You might need to wait and apply again if you\u2019ve been to a country that was especially hard hit by coronavirus.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Medical exam delays.<\/strong> If you apply for a policy that <a href=\"https:\/\/fidelitylife.com\/covid-19\/\">requires a medical exam,<\/a> exam companies are now taking extra precautions to keep their own workers safe. If you\u2019ve had the hallmark signs of coronavirus, like fever and respiratory distress, or traveled within affected areas, they may decide to delay your exam by 14 days.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nBottom line: Expect the process of purchasing a life insurance policy to take a little longer in some cases, which is why there\u2019s no time like the present to get started.\r\n<h2>What if I want to buy life insurance more quickly during the coronavirus outbreak?<\/h2>\r\nIf you want to get covered sooner, you have options. For many of Fidelity Life\u2019s life insurance plans, you can get approved in as little as one phone call, instead of waiting six to eight weeks.\r\n\r\nFor example, our <a href=\"\/life-insurance\/term-life-insurance\/rapidecision-life\/\"><em>RAPIDecision<\/em><\/a><a href=\"\/life-insurance\/term-life-insurance\/rapidecision-life\/\">\u00ae Life<\/a> insurance uses information from public databases and other sources to help many people get covered the same day they apply. You can typically qualify right away for a combination of traditional life insurance and accidental death coverage, which provides a payout if you die in an accident. If you choose, you then have up to six months to take a medical exam \u2013 giving you peace of mind while the coronavirus outbreak plays out. As long as the results line up with your initial application, your policy will provide a payout for any covered cause of death. Fidelity Life may also be able to waive the need for a medical exam altogether.\r\n\r\nMany of our other products, like\u00a0<a href=\"\/life-insurance\/final-expense-insurance\/rapidecision-final-expense-insurance\/\"><em>RAPID<\/em>ecision<\/a><a href=\"\/life-insurance\/final-expense-insurance\/rapidecision-final-expense-insurance\/\">\u00ae Final Expense<\/a>, also let you lock in coverage quickly with no waiting period or required underwriting.\r\n<h2>Am I covered from coronavirus if I already have life insurance?<\/h2>\r\nAs long as you have an active life insurance policy, coronavirus \u2013 like any other illness \u2013 would typically be covered. Some other plans, <a href=\"https:\/\/fidelitylife.com\/life-insurance\/accidental-death-insurance\/\">like accidental death benefit coverage,<\/a> only cover you in case of an accident, not an illness. While most people who contract coronavirus thankfully will have mild cases, you can count on life insurance to protect your family in a worst-case scenario. If you\u2019re concerned about your coverage, talk to your carrier about the specifics of your policy.\r\n<h2>Working together to stay safe<\/h2>\r\nNow, more than ever, is the time to work together to stay safe and healthy. With the right planning and safety precautions, you and your family can work with the rest of your community to curb the spread of the coronavirus. If you\u2019re looking to take extra precautions, give our agents a call to talk about your life insurance options. <a href=\"https:\/\/fidelitylife.com\/support\/\">We\u2019re here to help<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Fidelity Life, our goal is to make life insurance simple, affordable, and understandable for everyday families.

to putting customers first. For the third year in a row, Newsweek has named Fidelity Life in its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/americas-best-customer-service-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">America\u2019s Best Customer Service <\/a>rankings.\r\n\r\nThe award is especially meaningful to us this year, when the need for financial protection is greater than ever. Since we first opened our doors, our mission has been to help Americans achieve financial security with life insurance plans that meet their needs each step of the way.\r\n<h2>Recognizing a reputation for service<\/h2>\r\nTo develop the America\u2019s Best Customer Service rankings, Newsweek and global research company Statista surveyed 25,000 Americans about their favorite products and services. Customers shared their experiences with brick-and-mortar companies, online retailers, and service providers in 160 categories across a wide range of industries.\r\n\r\nNewsweek and Statista awarded companies based on a combination of Net Promoter Score (how likely the customer was to recommend the company to friends and family) and five additional criteria:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>Quality of communications:<\/strong> Whether the company was friendly and helpful when the customer contacted them<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Professional competence:<\/strong> Whether the company answered the customer\u2019s questions correctly and thoroughly<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Range of services:<\/strong> If the services available met the customer\u2019s expectations<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Customer focus:<\/strong><b> Whether the company provided personalized service based on the customer\u2019s unique needs<\/b><\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Accessibility:<\/strong> How accessible the company was, either in person, over the phone, or online<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nBased on that feedback, Newsweek evaluated companies and awarded the top three to five companies in each category. Fidelity Life was recognized in the Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&amp;D) insurance category, making us part of these rankings each year Newsweek has given the award.\r\n\r\nThe full list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/americas-best-customer-service-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">America\u2019s Best Customer Service Award 2021<\/a> winners is now available online and will also appear in an upcoming print edition of Newsweek Magazine.\r\n<h2><strong>Working with you, for life<\/strong><\/h2>\r\nAt Fidelity Life, we\u2019re grateful to all our customers for their support and to our employees for providing excellent service each day.\r\n\r\nAs we enter 2021, we\u2019re focused on finding new and innovative ways to serve families, including:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><strong>A broad range of affordable products.<\/strong><b> We know our customers have unique needs. We offer a variety of term, permanent, and final expense life insurance plans that fit families\u2019 budgets and provide protection at every stage of life.\u00a0<\/b><\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Fast application and approvals.<\/strong> Our customers can now buy online or over the phone, with plans starting the same day, in many cases. We\u2019re proud to offer coverage quickly during these uncertain times, so our customers can have peace of mind sooner.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Convenient coverage.<\/strong> With many people seeking coverage from home, Fidelity Life offers contactless ways to buy life insurance safely. Our patented process allows us to defer medical exams for up to six months after coverage is approved, and many plans don\u2019t require an exam at all.<\/li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Help when it\u2019s needed.<\/strong> When our customers have questions, our licensed agents are here to guide them through their options and find the right plan.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nProtecting what\u2019s precious matters to our customers, and it matters to us, too. We\u2019re proud to be honored for our service, and we\u2019re humbled by the opportunity to continue helping families secure their financial futures.\r\n<i>\r\nAt Fidelity Life, our goal is to make life insurance simple, affordable, and understandable for everyday families.
