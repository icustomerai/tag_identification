Dobson is so excited to be back home in Kentucky and to be a part of the WAVE Storm Tracking Team! Jessica joined the team in January 2022 and you can catch her forecasts on Weekend Sunrise.\n\nJessica is a Louisville, KY native and has had a fascination for weather for as long as she can remember. She attended and graduated from Seneca High School and then Western Kentucky University where she was chosen to participate in the award-winning Field Methods in Weather Analysis and Forecasting class. This class gave Jessica the chance to forecast severe convective weather and storm chase across the country two years in a row. While storm chasing, Jessica and her classmates chased and documented over 20 tornadoes and countless storms.\n\nWhen she wasn’t studying and chasing storms, you could also find Jessica at dance team practice for the WKU Topperettes. Jessica was a member of the team for three years and had numerous opportunities to volunteer in the community and to cheer on her favorite team, The Hilltoppers! Go Tops!\n\nDuring her senior year, Jessica got a head start on her broadcast meteorology career when she became the Weekday Evening Meteorologist in Bowling Green, KY. After graduating, Jessica moved to Decatur, IL and became the Weekday Morning Meteorologist at WAND-TV. While in Decatur, Jessica got her fair share of extremes when it came to forecasting. From tracking tornadoes to wind-chills of -40°, Jessica learned a lot when it came to predicting the uncertain weather of the Midwest. From there, Jessica traveled to warm and sunny Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to work as a meteorologist at WMBF News. While at the beach, Jessica had the opportunity to forecast and experience hurricanes, tropical storms, along with plenty of South Carolina heat and humidity. \n\nWhile Jessica loved the beach, she couldn't be happier to be back in her hometown of Louisville! She's excited for the challenge of forecasting and predicting weather in the Ohio Valley. Jessica also loves seeing your weather photos!

","longBio":"Elisa Schwartzmiller joined WAVE News in May 2022. \n\nBefore joining WAVE, Elisa worked at sister station WSAZ in Huntington, West Virginia. There she was a producer, digital content producer as well as the assignment manager for two years. She covered stories ranging from crime to community events for parts of Eastern Kentucky, Southern West Virginia, and Southeastern Ohio. \n\nElisa is originally from Clarksburg, West Virginia. She attended West Virginia University and was the executive producer for WVU News in the spring of 2020. During her time at WVU, she interned with West Virginia Public Broadcasting and spent her summers at a local station in her hometown. \n\nWhen she isn't at work, Elisa is usually spending time exploring the city, at Trader Joe's or catching up with her family via FaceTime. Since she grew up around mountains, if there is any reason to be outside, she's going to be there. \n\nElisa grew up around horses and is excited to be living in the Derby City.

Mattingly is a Louisville native, attended Seneca High School and now serves as a reporter at WAVE News.\n\nHe is a Peabody and Emmy Award-winning journalist with decades of experience reporting domestically and abroad. But no assignment has ever made him happier than coming home to the city where he was born and working at the station he grew up watching.\n\nIt took David a long time to find his way back to Louisville. For 23 years he had a front-row seat to history as a CNN National Correspondent reporting on many of the most important and most talked about news stories of our time:\n\nThe Sept. 11 attacks, Hurricane Katrina, Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman, Virginia Tech shootings, Columbine and Aurora, the Scott Peterson trial, Gore vs. Bush, the Space Shuttle Columbia crash, the BP Gulf oil spill, the Casey Anthony trial, the Boston Marathon bombings, ebola, Mississippi floods, the D.C. sniper, the Miracle on the Hudson, the Ferguson riots and more.\n\nIn addition to countless newsmakers and celebrities, David has interviewed, covered or met every U.S. President from Gerald Ford to Donald Trump. He has earned a reputation as a challenging interviewer as well as a provocative and compelling storyteller. David is known for his signature \"in-the-moment\" style of reporting that draws on moments of unguarded spontaneity.\n\nPrior to CNN, David was an award-winning anchor, reporter and documentary producer at WVTM, the NBC affiliate in Birmingham, Ala., where he worked for 10 years and developed one of the country's first environmental reporting franchises, a groundbreaking series called \"EarthSave.\"\n\nDavid was inspired to become a journalist by the Watergate scandal and the work of Washington Post correspondents Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.\n\n\"They deeply influenced my view of the profession and the need for journalists who are not afraid to ask hard questions,\" David says. \"I look for any opportunity to instill that same sense of purpose in new generations who are curious about the world around them and eager to make it better.\"\n\nSo far, David's travels have taken him more than a million miles, to all 50 states and more than 20 countries. His work for CNN has been featured by filmmakers in internationally released movies and by nationally syndicated programs, including Oprah and the Barbara Walters Special.\n\nDavid is committed to mentoring young reporters and is a popular speaker at journalism schools, including his alma mater, the University of Alabama.","org":"WAVE","owner":{"id":"gray"},"podcasts":[],"slug":"david-mattingly","source":{"source_id":"59802"},"status":true,"twitter":"MattinglyWAVE3","type":"author","version":"0.6.0","last_updated_date":"2023-06-22T15:10:11.956Z","custom_gray_stationname":"wave","custom_gray_stationdepartment":"news","role":"Reporter","custom_gray_displaypriority":"11"}}}]},"display_date":"2023-06-23T20:03:26.358Z","description":{"basic":"Louisville Metro Public Health and Wellness says COVID vaccines are still a great idea."},"headlines":{"basic":"Vaccines still recommended as COVID numbers drop","meta_title":"","mobile":"","native":"","print":"","tablet":"","web":""},"promo_items":{"basic":{"_id":"RQLHCZ3JDVFU5DVBBC63MJ6EYM","additional_properties":{"countryId":227,"fullSizeResizeUrl":"/resizer/DuHFJ_lFkuNTijSZdI8wLs-DboA=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/RQLHCZ3JDVFU5DVBBC63MJ6EYM.jpg","galleries":[],"ingestionMethod":"manual","iptc_job_identifier":"NYAB507","iptc_source":"AP","iptc_title":"","keywords":["omicron"],"mime_type":"image/jpeg","originalName":"AP23167715061242.jpg","originalUrl":"https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gray/RQLHCZ3JDVFU5DVBBC63MJ6EYM.jpg","owner":"greg.brobeck@gray.tv","proxyUrl":"/resizer/DuHFJ_lFkuNTijSZdI8wLs-DboA=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/RQLHCZ3JDVFU5DVBBC63MJ6EYM.jpg","published":true,"resizeUrl":"/resizer/DuHFJ_lFkuNTijSZdI8wLs-DboA=/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/RQLHCZ3JDVFU5DVBBC63MJ6EYM.jpg","restricted":false,"takenOn":"2022-11-17T18:12:21Z","thumbnailResizeUrl":"/resizer/cC5IAqlIo2eX4ErstqZVUFsKFQA=/300x0/arc-photo-gray/arc3-prod/public/RQLHCZ3JDVFU5DVBBC63MJ6EYM.jpg","usage_instructions":"Cease usage in 30 days","version":0,"template_id":32},"address":{"locality":"Richmond","region":"VA","country_name":"USA"},"auth":{"3":"5d00a52129043914527a4508f07705080aa85308b9441809167b364b79284c1c"},"caption":"FILE - Louisville Metro Public Health and Wellness says while COVID may not be dominating the headlines like it used to, it is still out there and still infecting people.
